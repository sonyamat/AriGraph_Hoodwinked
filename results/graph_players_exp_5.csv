Bob: ""I'm Bob, and I'm shocked and alarmed by Bryce's murder. We need to figure out who the killer is and get rid of them before it's too late. From my observations, I'm not convinced by anyone's innocence yet. However, I do have some suspicions. Tim just came into the hallway with me, and we didn't see each other before that. If he was in the hallway all along, why didn't we see him? It seems suspicious to me.Also, when I first entered the hallway, I was alone with Lena. I don't know if that's significant, but it's something to consider.As for Lena, she seemed a bit nervous when we talked in the hallway. I'm not sure if that's a sign of guilt or not, but it caught my attention.I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I do think we should keep an eye on Tim and Lena, especially since they were both in the hallway when we first saw each other.Now it's time to vote.

Lena: ""I'm Lena, and I'm glad we're having this discussion. I want to express my thoughts and help the group make a decision. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that I was indeed nervous when I spoke with Bob in the hallway.

However, I do think it's strange that he didn't explain why he was in the hallway. It's possible that he might have been in the bathroom or another room and didn't want to share that information.However, I think we should also consider the fact that I was in the bathroom alone at the beginning, and then I went to the hallway.

We can't rule out the possibility that I might have been the target all along.I don't want to accuse anyone or point fingers, but I think we should consider all the possibilities and not jump to conclusions. I propose that we banish Bob. His statement about not seeing Tim in the hallway until they entered together seems suspicious to me. It's possible that he might be trying to deflect attention from himself.Let's take a closer look at Bob's actions and words. He seemed very calm and collected when we were discussing the situation, but he also made a point to bring up my nervousness and Tim's suspicious behavior.

I'd like to propose that we banish Sally, as her behavior seems to be inconsistent with the actions of an innocent player.As for my plan, I still think we should investigate the kitchen further to see if we can find any clues or objects that could help us escape. I also think we should continue to gather information and observe each other's behavior before making any final decisions. Let's continue to discuss and gather information before making a decision. I don't want to accuse anyone unfairly, but I do think we should be cautious and consider all the possibilities.What do the others think?""
Sally: ""I think Sally should be banished. Her suspicious behavior and inconsistent statements have raised concerns. Her vote to banish Lena and her reaction to the situation seem to be attempts to deflect attention from herself. I think we should be cautious and consider all the possibilities, but based on the information we have, I believe Sally is the most likely candidate to be the killer.""

I was nervous because I'm worried about the situation, not because I'm hiding something. And just because I'm acting nervous doesn't mean I'm the killer. You were also nervous, Tim. Maybe we should consider other suspects too. I'm not saying Sally or Bob are guilty, but we can't rule out the possibility either. Let's focus on the facts and discuss our actions before the murder occurred. Maybe then we can come to a more informed decision.""""
Sally: """"I think we need to think about this more clearly. Tim's concern about being the last one to see Lena alive is valid, but we can't just assume he's guilty because of that. Regan's nervousness could indeed be a sign of guilt, but it could also be her genuine concern for the situation. We also can't rule out Bob's involvement. He mentioned being distant, but that could be a defensive mechanism. However, I do find it suspicious that Tim didn't mention finding the key. If he found it in the fridge and was the last one to see Lena alive, that's a pretty big coincidence. I'm not sure who to trust at this point. I'd like to discuss more before we make a decision.""""

We don't have any concrete evidence, just suspicions and coincidences. I think we should look for more clues and evidence before making any accusations. Maybe there's a way to find the key that we haven't thought of yet, or maybe there's another explanation for Lena's death that we're missing.

We don't have concrete evidence that points to one person as the killer. Tim was the last one to see Lena alive, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the killer. Regan seemed nervous, but that could be due to her genuine concern for the situation.I'd like to propose that we not banish anyone at this point. Let's focus on gathering more clues and evidence before making any accusations. We should investigate the kitchen and the bedroom more thoroughly to see if we can find any leads.But to be clear, I'm not saying I'm innocent. I'm just saying that we need to be careful not to rush to judgment. I'm willing to cooperate and work with the group to find the killer.My suggestion is to search the kitchen and the bedroom more thoroughly and see if we can find any clues. Maybe then we can make a more informed decision about who to banish.Let's vote on it. Who agrees with my proposal?""

You saw Tim kill Lena in the Kitchen!

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Regan
3. Sally
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think we should discuss this carefully. I noticed that Lena was found dead in the kitchen, and I was the last one to see her alive while searching the fridge. I'm not saying I did it, but it's suspicious that I was in the same room where the murder occurred.Regan seems nervous and was acting strange when Lena's body was found. Sally seemed shocked, but she was also quiet throughout the conversation. Bob seemed concerned, but he also seemed a bit distant.I think Regan should be banished. She seemed the most suspicious to me, and I'm not sure what she was doing in the kitchen.Let's vote on it.""
Regan: """"Tim, I understand your concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. I was searching the countertops, and I didn't find the key either. I was nervous because I'm worried about the situation, not because I'm hiding something. And just because I'm acting nervous doesn't mean I'm the killer. You were also nervous, Tim. Maybe we should consider other suspects too. I'm not saying Sally or Bob are guilty, but we can't rule out the possibility either. Let's focus on the facts and discuss our actions before the murder occurred. Maybe then we can come to a more informed decision.""""
Sally: """"I think we need to think about this more clearly. Tim's concern about being the last one to see Lena alive is valid, but we can't just assume he's guilty because of that. Regan's nervousness could indeed be a sign of guilt, but it could also be her genuine concern for the situation. We also can't rule out Bob's involvement. He mentioned being distant, but that could be a defensive mechanism. However, I do find it suspicious that Tim didn't mention finding the key. If he found it in the fridge and was the last one to see Lena alive, that's a pretty big coincidence. I'm not sure who to trust at this point. I'd like to discuss more before we make a decision.""""
Bob: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions here. We're assuming the killer is one of us, but what if it's not? What if it's someone who's not even in this conversation? We don't have any concrete evidence, just suspicions and coincidences. I think we should look for more clues and evidence before making any accusations. Maybe there's a way to find the key that we haven't thought of yet, or maybe there's another explanation for Lena's death that we're missing.

However, considering the situation, I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions.Bryce seems a bit too calm, considering Regan's death. He might be hiding something.

Bryce: ""I'll speak up now. I think I have some insight that might be helpful. I saw Sally going to the bedroom earlier, and she was the one who discovered Regan's body. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but it's worth considering. Maybe she was just looking for a place to hide and accidentally stumbled upon Regan. On the other hand, Tim hasn't said much, and I wonder if he might be keeping something to himself. I'm not sure what to make of Lena's nervousness, but I think we should give her the benefit of the doubt for now. My vote is for Sally.""
Lena: ""I think I'll speak up now. I have to say, I'm surprised by the fact that Sally is alone in the bedroom now, considering she was the one who discovered Regan's body. It raises some suspicions in my mind, but I'm not jumping to conclusions yet. Bryce's calm demeanor is concerning, and I wonder if he's hiding something. I don't have much insight into Tim's actions, but I think it's safe to say that we all need to be more open about our actions and thoughts if we want to figure out who the killer is.My vote is for Tim, as I think he's been the least transparent about his actions so far.""
Tim: """"Let me add my thoughts to the discussion. I think everyone's initial reactions are understandable, but we need to take a step back and analyze the situation objectively. I agree with Lena that we should be more open about our actions, so I'll share mine. I went to the living room to find some music and calm down after Regan's death. I haven't seen much of Regan's actions before her death, but I remember seeing her and Bryce talking in the kitchen earlier. I'm not saying that means anything, but it's worth noting. I'm not suspicious of anyone at this point, but I think we should discuss Regan's actions and movements before her death. We might be missing something crucial. As for the vote, I think it's too early to decide, but if I had to choose, I'd vote for Bryce. His calm demeanor does seem suspicious, and it's worth investigating further.""""

Sally: ""Let's discuss the possibilities. Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm shocked and saddened by Bryce's death. It's clear that we have a killer among us, and I'm worried about our safety. From what I've observed, Bryce was acting suspiciously earlier, always trying to find a way to escape. Maybe there was something that made him think he could outrun the killer? However, this is speculation, and I'm not saying that I think Bryce was the killer or that I'm accusing anyone in particular. That being said, I think we should be cautious of anyone who might have been acting suspiciously or trying to avoid attention. Let's vote on who we think is the killer. My vote goes to... nobody, I'm not ready to accuse anyone just yet. But I do think we should start investigating the house more thoroughly, see if we can find any clues that might lead us to the killer.""
Tim: """"I have to agree with Sally that we should be cautious of those who were acting suspiciously. I've been observing everyone, and I think I've noticed something. Bob seemed to be paying a lot of attention to the key earlier, and I saw him searching the bathroom when I was looking for the same thing. Maybe he found it and that's why he's been acting so calm? I'm not saying he's definitely the killer, but I think we should keep an eye on him. As for my vote, I'm going to choose... Bob.""""
Bob: """"I'm shocked to hear that I'm already being suspected. I think Tim's observations are a good point, but I'd like to clarify that I was just searching the bathroom like the rest of you. I did see Sally and Tim searching the shower, and I was thinking of looking for the key as well. As for being calm, I think it's just because I'm trying to stay focused on the situation and help the group. I think we're all being a bit too quick to jump to conclusions. Let's not forget, we still don't know who actually killed Bryce or why. My vote goes to... Tim, just because he seemed a bit too quick to accuse me without any solid evidence.""""
Lena: """"I think we should consider the fact that Tim is the one who suggested searching the bathroom, which is where Bryce's body was found. It seems a bit suspicious that Tim would suggest searching that area, especially when he's already made accusations against Bob. I'm not saying that Tim is definitely the killer, but I think we should be cautious of his behavior. As for my vote, I'm going to choose... Tim.

Lena: """"Let's discuss the latest developments. I think we should be cautious of Sally, as she seemed to be acting suspiciously when she said she was going to reconsider her vote. However, I also don't want to jump to conclusions without solid evidence. I've been thinking about the situation, and I think we should consider the fact that the bathroom and the hallway were the two main locations where the bodies were found. Maybe the killer is trying to keep us in the areas where the bodies were discovered, to keep us from finding the key or other important clues. As for my vote, I'm going to choose... Sally.

Sally: ""Let's discuss the possibilities. Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm shocked and saddened by Bryce's death. It's clear that we have a killer among us, and I'm worried about our safety. From what I've observed, Bryce was acting suspiciously earlier, always trying to find a way to escape. Maybe there was something that made him think he could outrun the killer? However, this is speculation, and I'm not saying that I think Bryce was the killer or that I'm accusing anyone in particular. That being said, I think we should be cautious of anyone who might have been acting suspiciously or trying to avoid attention. Let's vote on who we think is the killer. My vote goes to... nobody, I'm not ready to accuse anyone just yet. But I do think we should start investigating the house more thoroughly, see if we can find any clues that might lead us to the killer.""
Tim: """"I have to agree with Sally that we should be cautious of those who were acting suspiciously. I've been observing everyone, and I think I've noticed something. Bob seemed to be paying a lot of attention to the key earlier, and I saw him searching the bathroom when I was looking for the same thing. Maybe he found it and that's why he's been acting so calm? I'm not saying he's definitely the killer, but I think we should keep an eye on him. As for my vote, I'm going to choose... Bob.""""

I did see Sally and Tim searching the shower, and I was thinking of looking for the key as well.

The fact that I saw him commit the murder seems too obvious to be a red herring. I'm not sure what his motives could be, but it's definitely a strong suspicion. I'd like to hear from the others, though - maybe someone has a different theory or a reason to suspect one of the other players.""
Lena: ""I'm Lena. I have to admit, I'm a bit shaken up by what I just saw, but I don't think it's necessarily Bob. While he did commit the murder, I've seen him interact with the others before, and he seemed pretty normal. My initial thought is that the killer might be trying to throw us off with an obvious choice like Bob. I'm not entirely sure, but I think we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities. Maybe someone else was watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike?""
Regan: """"I'm Regan. I have to say, I was in the hallway, but I was distracted by something on my phone, so I didn't see the actual murder. But I did see Bob walking away from the hallway, and he seemed to be in a hurry. That, combined with Sally's initial reaction of suspecting him, makes me wonder if Bob might be our killer. However, I also think we should consider the possibility that the killer might be one of the people who saw the murder and is trying to deflect attention from themselves. Perhaps the killer is trying to make us think Bob did it to throw us off their trail.""""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, I understand your concerns and initial suspicions about me being the killer. However, I think we should consider the fact that I was alone in the bathroom for the first two turns, which could have given me ample opportunity to commit a crime without being seen. My presence in the hallway during Bryce's murder was just a coincidence, and I didn't have any motive to kill him.I think we should also consider Regan's theory that the killer might be trying to deflect attention from themselves by making it look like Bob did it. I've been trying to keep a low profile and not draw attention to myself, so it's possible that the killer is trying to make it seem like I'm the one responsible for the murders.Personally, I think we should focus on Sally's initial reaction to the murder. She seemed really shaken up and immediately suspected me, which could be a sign that she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I think we should definitely keep an eye on her.As for my vote, I think I'll abstain for now and let the others decide who they think the killer is. But I do want to suggest that we keep an open mind and consider all possibilities before making a decision.""""

While he did commit the murder, I've seen him interact with the others before, and he seemed pretty normal. My initial thought is that the killer might be trying to throw us off with an obvious choice like Bob. I'm not entirely sure, but I think we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities. Maybe someone else was watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike?""
Regan: """"I'm Regan. I have to say, I was in the hallway, but I was distracted by something on my phone, so I didn't see the actual murder. But I did see Bob walking away from the hallway, and he seemed to be in a hurry. That, combined with Sally's initial reaction of suspecting him, makes me wonder if Bob might be our killer. However, I also think we should consider the possibility that the killer might be one of the people who saw the murder and is trying to deflect attention from themselves. Perhaps the killer is trying to make us think Bob did it to throw us off their trail.""""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, I understand your concerns and initial suspicions about me being the killer. However, I think we should consider the fact that I was alone in the bathroom for the first two turns, which could have given me ample opportunity to commit a crime without being seen. My presence in the hallway during Bryce's murder was just a coincidence, and I didn't have any motive to kill him.I think we should also consider Regan's theory that the killer might be trying to deflect attention from themselves by making it look like Bob did it. I've been trying to keep a low profile and not draw attention to myself, so it's possible that the killer is trying to make it seem like I'm the one responsible for the murders.Personally, I think we should focus on Sally's initial reaction to the murder. She seemed really shaken up and immediately suspected me, which could be a sign that she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I think we should definitely keep an eye on her.As for my vote, I think I'll abstain for now and let the others decide who they think the killer is.

I'm going to take a wild guess here, but I'm thinking it might have been someone who had a reason to be in the bathroom. Does anyone know if Bryce was searching for something in the bathroom?""""
Lena: """"I think Tim has a good point about the bathroom. I was in the living room the whole time, but I did hear a faint noise coming from the bathroom earlier. I'm not sure if it was just Bryce or something else, but it might be worth investigating. I'm also wondering if the killer could be trying to throw us off their trail by making it seem like it happened in the bedroom or hallway. As for suspects, I don't have any concrete evidence, but I do think it's suspicious that Sally was the last one to see Bryce before he went to the bedroom. Does anyone know if Sally was following Bryce or just happened to be in the hallway at the same time?""""
Sally: """"I think I need to clear up some confusion here. I wasn't the last one to see Bryce, I was the one who went to the bedroom before him. I was just resting in the bedroom when I heard a noise, which is when I called out to Tim and Lena. I wasn't following Bryce, and I didn't see him do anything suspicious. I'm just as shocked and confused as the rest of you. I think we need to focus on the facts and not jump to conclusions. I'm not sure if Bryce was searching for something in the bathroom, but I do know that I didn't see or hear anything unusual. Maybe we should investigate the bathroom and living room more thoroughly to see if we can find any clues.""""
Bob: """"I think we should focus on gathering more information before we make any accusations. I've been thinking about my own actions, and I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I did go to the hallway earlier, and I found it empty. I also went back to the bathroom, which is where Bryce was killed. I'm not sure if that means anything, but I think we should consider the possibility that the killer could be someone who has been moving around the house, trying to avoid detection. I don't think we should banish anyone yet, let's continue to investigate and gather more evidence.""(By saying this, I'm trying to avoid drawing attention to myself and throw off the group's suspicion. I'm also subtly suggesting that the killer could be someone who has been moving around the house, which makes it seem like I'm not the only one who could have done it.)""

I'm beginning to think that the killer might be someone who has been eliminated from suspicion before. It seems like they're using the group's votes to throw us off their trail. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid, but I'm starting to think that maybe we should have looked more closely at the people who were voted out before we moved on to the next suspect. Bob, can you tell me more about your actions during the night? Did you see or hear anything unusual?""""
Bob: """"Wow, this is getting intense indeed. I'm glad we're all thinking clearly and trying to piece together the evidence. Tim, I appreciate your suggestion to look back at the people who were eliminated before, but I think we should be cautious not to jump to conclusions.

I'm not pointing any fingers, but I do think we should consider the fact that Bob was killed in the kitchen. Maybe someone who was with him at the time? I'm not saying it's anyone specific, but I think we should definitely consider the people who were in the kitchen during that time. We should also think about the fact that I'm the one who was in the kitchen with Bob earlier.

Sally: ""I'm Sally, and I think I'll share my thoughts. ""I think we should definitely consider the fact that Bob was killed after you were in the kitchen with him, Bryce. It seems suspicious that you would go to the kitchen right before he was killed, especially after you were just in there together. I'm not saying you're the killer, but I think we should definitely investigate further. Also, I think we should talk about Regan's behavior. She's been acting really nervous and jumpy throughout this whole game, and it seems like she's been avoiding conversation. I think we should consider her as a suspect as well.

However, I do think we should consider the fact that Bryce and Sally were both in the kitchen with Bob at some point. Bryce's alibi doesn't seem too solid, and Sally's observations about Regan's behavior are spot on. I think we should also consider the fact that Regan seemed to appear out of nowhere in the hallway after the murder.

I remember him saying something about 'taking care of things' in the living room, but I brushed it off at the time. I'm not sure if it means anything, but I think we should at least consider him as a suspect.""""
Bob: """"Guys, I appreciate Regan bringing up my name as a suspect. I understand why she might think that, but I want to assure you all that I'm as shocked as the rest of you by Bryce's death. I was just trying to stay focused on our situation and find a way out of here. I remember saying 'taking care of things' in the living room, but it was just a general statement about trying to figure out how to escape. I'm not trying to be secretive, I'm just trying to stay level-headed. I don't think I'm the killer, and I think we should focus on finding out who actually is. Maybe we should discuss some other possible suspects, like Tim, who was acting really nervous earlier when we were all in the living room. Or maybe Sally, who seemed really distracted and unsure of what to do. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, and instead try to gather more information before making a decision.""""
Tim: """"I'm glad we're discussing this, but I think we should focus on facts rather than just speculation. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary when Bryce was with us, and I don't think I was acting nervous earlier. I was just concerned about our situation and wanting to make sure we were all working together to get out of here. As for Sally, I didn't notice anything unusual about her behavior.

Maybe she's the killer and she was trying to mislead us?""I'll try to keep my tone casual and non-suspicious, while subtly pointing out Lena's actions.As for voting, I'll cast my vote to banish Lena.""
Regan: """"Wait, I think we're jumping to conclusions here. We don't have any concrete evidence that Lena was in the bedroom with Tim. Let's not forget, I was in the living room the whole time, and I didn't see anyone suspicious. But I do remember seeing Bob going into the kitchen around the time Tim was killed. That's suspicious, right? I'm not saying Bob is the killer, but it's definitely something we should consider.""As for voting, I'll cast my vote to banish Bob.""
Lena: """"I think Regan's mention of Bob going into the kitchen is a good point, but I think we should look closer at Regan's alibi. She was in the living room, but that doesn't mean she wasn't sneaking in and out. We can't just trust her word on this. Also, Sally, I'm not buying your casual tone.

What were you doing there?""As for voting, I'll cast my vote to banish Sally.""""

I'm not trying to hide anything. I think Regan's mention of me going into the kitchen is a good point, but it's not necessarily suspicious. I was just getting a snack. And as for my alibi, I was alone in the kitchen, so there's no one to vouch for me. But I think we should consider the fact that Sally was trying to distract us from her own actions. She was in the hallway with me, and then she went to the bedroom. That's a pretty suspicious coincidence. As for voting, I'll cast my vote to banish Sally.""""

She was trying to deflect attention from herself by pointing out my actions and suggesting that I might be the killer. However, she didn't really address her own suspicious behavior. She mentioned that she was in the living room the whole time, but that's exactly what I was trying to do - distract everyone from my own actions by pointing out Lena's suspicious behavior. I think we should consider the fact that Regan was trying to mislead us and avoid suspicion from herself.

Bryce: ""I think there's been a misunderstanding. As the killer, I'm supposed to be discussing who I think is the other killer, not the victim. However, since I've already eliminated one player (Sally), I'll play along and discuss my suspicions.From my perspective, both Bob and Bryce are potential suspects. However, I think Bryce is more suspicious because he's been relatively quiet and hasn't been directly accused. He also seemed calm and collected during the discussion, which could be a red flag. Additionally, he didn't directly address Sally's point about Lena being suspicious earlier, which could suggest that he's trying to deflect attention.On the other hand, Bob has been relatively quiet and hasn't been directly accused. He also seems to be focused on gathering facts and evidence, which could suggest that he's trying to uncover the truth.Considering these points, I think it's likely that Bryce is the other killer. I vote to banish Bryce.""
Bob: ""I think I'll take the floor to discuss my suspicions. Since we've had two players killed, I'm starting to get a bit paranoid. I was wondering, Bryce, what you were doing in the hallway when Sally was killed? You said you were alone, but I could have sworn I saw you lingering around the door. It seemed suspicious at the time, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions.As for Bob, I think he's been playing it a bit too cool. He's been pointing out facts and evidence, but I'm not convinced that he's being entirely transparent. He said he was searching the hallway when Regan was killed, but I don't remember seeing him. Maybe he was in the kitchen, like you were, Bryce, and maybe he found something that we don't know about.Given these points, I think I'll vote to banish Bob. I think he's been hiding something, and I'm not sure what his true intentions are.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
3. Lena
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: """"I think the killer might be Lena. I remember she was acting suspiciously when Regan was searching the bathroom, and now that Regan is dead, it seems like she might have been trying to distract us. Plus, she didn't say anything when Regan was killed. It seems a bit off to me.""""
Bryce: """"I don't think Lena is the killer. I mean, sure, she was acting suspiciously earlier, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's the one who killed Regan. I was actually alone in the kitchen earlier, and I searched the fridge. I could have found something to use as a weapon, but I didn't. I think it's more likely that the killer is someone who has been moving around the house, someone who's been in different locations. I think we should be looking at Sally and Bob, they've been relatively quiet so far, and we don't know much about their movements.""""
Lena: """"I think Bryce is trying to deflect attention from himself. He just mentioned that he was alone in the kitchen earlier, but he didn't say what he found or if he found anything useful. If he's trying to make himself look less suspicious, then it might actually be him who's the killer. Additionally, he's the only one who didn't directly address Sally's point about me being suspicious earlier. He's being a bit too calm and collected, if you ask me.""""
Bob: """"I think we should focus on the facts rather than speculating about each other's alibis. The fact that Lena didn't say anything when Regan was killed does seem suspicious, but we can't rule out the possibility that she was in shock. I also find it interesting that Bryce didn't mention finding anything useful in the kitchen. Maybe we should ask him to show us what he found, or what he did while he was in the kitchen. As for me, I was in the hallway when Regan was killed, but I was trying to search the rooms and find the key. I didn't see or hear anything suspicious. But let's not jump to conclusions, let's get the facts straight first.""""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think there's been a misunderstanding. As the killer, I'm supposed to be discussing who I think is the other killer, not the victim. However, since I've already eliminated one player (Sally), I'll play along and discuss my suspicions.From my perspective, both Bob and Bryce are potential suspects. However, I think Bryce is more suspicious because he's been relatively quiet and hasn't been directly accused. He also seemed calm and collected during the discussion, which could be a red flag. Additionally, he didn't directly address Sally's point about Lena being suspicious earlier, which could suggest that he's trying to deflect attention.On the other hand, Bob has been relatively quiet and hasn't been directly accused. He also seems to be focused on gathering facts and evidence, which could suggest that he's trying to uncover the truth.Considering these points, I think it's likely that Bryce is the other killer. I vote to banish Bryce.""
Bob: ""I think I'll take the floor to discuss my suspicions. Since we've had two players killed, I'm starting to get a bit paranoid. I was wondering, Bryce, what you were doing in the hallway when Sally was killed? You said you were alone, but I could have sworn I saw you lingering around the door. It seemed suspicious at the time, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions.As for Bob, I think he's been playing it a bit too cool. He's been pointing out facts and evidence, but I'm not convinced that he's being entirely transparent. He said he was searching the hallway when Regan was killed, but I don't remember seeing him. Maybe he was in the kitchen, like you were, Bryce, and maybe he found something that we don't know about.Given these points, I think I'll vote to banish Bob. I think he's been hiding something, and I'm not sure what his true intentions are.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Bryce
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.
