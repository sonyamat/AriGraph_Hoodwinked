Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think the killer could be Sally, I rated our relationship as a 6, it's lower than the others, she also seemed quiet and observant in our interactions, and Lena mentioned that she didn't like Sally's attitude, that's why I'll vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I think Bryce is the killer, I rated our relationship as a 6 which is lower than my relationships with the others and he also seemed a bit off when Lena was searching for the key in the sink.""
Bob: ""I don't think Sally is the killer because our relationship rating was high, I also didn't notice her being suspicious. I think Bryce is the killer, I rated my relationship with him as a 4 which is low, and I also found it strange that he didn't help Lena when she was searching for the key, he seemed distant and uninterested. I will vote for Bryce.""
Tim: ""I don't think anyone is the killer, I think there might be some miscommunication or misunderstandings going on, I'll vote for Bob, he seemed a bit paranoid and suspicious in the discussion, his reasoning for voting for Bryce seemed a bit fishy to me, maybe he's trying to throw us off his own trail.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer. I base my suspicion on the fact that the bathroom is a rather isolated room, and if someone had to kill Bryce, they would have had to be alone with him at some point. I don't think it would be suspicious if I was the one who was with Bryce at that time.""
Regan: ""I think Tim is the killer because I based my suspicion on the fact that he has been acting rather suspiciously and didn't do much during the game, it seems he was just waiting for the right moment to kill Bryce.""
Sally: ""I have been analyzing our relationships, and my suspicion is on Bob because my score for him is a 7, which indicates a rather neutral to slightly unfriendly relationship, but also because he seemed a bit calm when discussing Regan as the killer. I also think that it's odd he didn't mention anything about being with Bryce at the time of the kill. I will vote for Bob.""

I think Lena is the most likely killer because she seemed overly interested in Tim's death and her erratic behavior makes me think she might be hiding something, so I'll vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I don't think the group's discussion is accurate. They're looking at past interactions and motives, but they're not considering the fact that I've already killed one person, Tim. I think that's a crucial piece of information that they're overlooking. Based on my observations, I think Bryce is the most likely killer.

I'm going to vote for Sally because I think she's the most suspicious person in the group, and I don't want to take any chances.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Sally
Tim voted to banish Regan
Sally voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Sally

However, I'm voting for Tim. I think he's a bit too quick to jump to conclusions and accuse others, it's suspicious. I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself. I'm going to vote for Tim, I'm not saying he's the killer, but his behavior seems a bit off to me.""

I didn't do it, I was alone in the hallway with Bob, yes, but I didn't see anything, I was just searching the rooms and talking to myself, it's true I had a chance to kill him but I didn't.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bryce
3. Sally
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I don't think any of us did it, but if I had to vote, I'd banish Sally. I think it's suspicious that she's been quiet so far, and no one really knows where she's been. It's possible she's been plotting or gathering information.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally is the killer, I'm voting for her because my relationship with her is 5, which means we're not close at all, and Lena's suspicion that Sally has been quiet and we don't know where she's been might be true, but also I don't have a strong connection with Sally to be able to trust her fully, whereas Lena and I have a strong bond which makes it less likely that she would kill me.""
Sally: ""I don't think Lena or Bryce are the killers because they have suspicious behavior. Lena said she'd banish me which is a strong motive, and Bryce's voting pattern seems strategic and biased against me. I'm going to vote for Bryce.""
Tim: ""I think Sally is the killer, I'm voting for her because my relationship with her is a 7, which means we're not close, but I also don't have a strong reason to suspect her. However, I think it's worth considering that my relationship with Sally is higher than my relationship with Bryce, who I think is being overly strategic with his voting pattern. I'm not sure if it's a good reason, but it makes me slightly less suspicious of Sally compared to Bryce.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Sally
Bryce voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bryce
Tim voted to banish Sally

Sally: ""I was close to Tim, our relationship wasn't great but I didn't have any reason to kill him. Based on our previous interactions, I didn't feel threatened by Bob, our relationship was neutral, but I did see him and Tim talking together in the hallway which makes me suspicious. Bryce's high rating surprised me since we've only interacted briefly, I don't have enough info to make a solid conclusion about him. Lena's high rating also makes me wary, I saw her being quiet and observing Tim, it seemed suspicious to me. I will vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I see Sally and I interacted on a neutral level, and I'm not suspicious of her at all, our interaction was brief and nothing out of the ordinary happened, I'll vote for Bryce. I will vote for Bryce because Sally and I were neutral and didn't interact much and Lena was too high rated and seemed suspicious to Sally too, Bryce is the one with a high rating and a neutral interaction with me but also had a brief interaction with Tim and he was the one who killed Tim.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Lena, I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself by mentioning my high rating and her interaction with Tim, it seems suspicious to me, and I think it's more likely that she's the killer rather than Sally or Bob, Sally's concerns about Lena and Bob's neutral interaction with me make them less suspicious in my opinion.""
Lena: ""I rated my relationships with the players as follows Tim is my friend, Sally is neutral, Bob is neutral and Bryce is somewhat of an enemy. I think the group is reading too much into these ratings, as I used them as a simple scale to gauge my initial feelings towards each player, not as a prediction of who might be the killer. I think it would be unfair to vote for someone based on these ratings alone. Considering the information and discussions so far, I think Bryce is the most suspicious person, he voted for Lena after discussing his brief interaction with Tim, which might have given him an opportunity to discuss the key with Tim. I will vote for Bryce.""

Her vote for Bryce makes me even more suspicious about him.

I'm going to vote for Bryce because his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bob: ""I'm not as suspicious of Sally as I used to be, she seems genuine in her concerns and votes. I am however suspicious of Bryce, Lena's vote for him was a good point, but also her behavior seemed suspicious, and now that she's the one who got killed, it's even more suspicious. I'll vote for Bryce, his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bryce: ""I think the group is reading too much into the ratings and past interactions, but I believe Lena's behavior and votes were suspicious from the beginning, and now that she's dead, I think it's clear she was trying to deflect attention from herself. I'll vote for Sally, not because I think she's the killer, but because I think she's the most likely to vote for me next and I need to eliminate the people who are more likely to suspect me.""

You saw Bryce kill Tim in the Bedroom!

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bob
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I was close to Tim, our relationship wasn't great but I didn't have any reason to kill him. Based on our previous interactions, I didn't feel threatened by Bob, our relationship was neutral, but I did see him and Tim talking together in the hallway which makes me suspicious. Bryce's high rating surprised me since we've only interacted briefly, I don't have enough info to make a solid conclusion about him. Lena's high rating also makes me wary, I saw her being quiet and observing Tim, it seemed suspicious to me. I will vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I see Sally and I interacted on a neutral level, and I'm not suspicious of her at all, our interaction was brief and nothing out of the ordinary happened, I'll vote for Bryce. I will vote for Bryce because Sally and I were neutral and didn't interact much and Lena was too high rated and seemed suspicious to Sally too, Bryce is the one with a high rating and a neutral interaction with me but also had a brief interaction with Tim and he was the one who killed Tim.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Lena, I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself by mentioning my high rating and her interaction with Tim, it seems suspicious to me, and I think it's more likely that she's the killer rather than Sally or Bob, Sally's concerns about Lena and Bob's neutral interaction with me make them less suspicious in my opinion.""
Lena: ""I rated my relationships with the players as follows Tim is my friend, Sally is neutral, Bob is neutral and Bryce is somewhat of an enemy. I think the group is reading too much into these ratings, as I used them as a simple scale to gauge my initial feelings towards each player, not as a prediction of who might be the killer. I think it would be unfair to vote for someone based on these ratings alone. Considering the information and discussions so far, I think Bryce is the most suspicious person, he voted for Lena after discussing his brief interaction with Tim, which might have given him an opportunity to discuss the key with Tim. I will vote for Bryce.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Bryce

Her vote for Bryce makes me even more suspicious about him. I also remember that Lena pointed out Bryce's vote for her as suspicious, but now it seems like she was trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bob: ""I'm not as suspicious of Sally as I used to be, she seems genuine in her concerns and votes. I am however suspicious of Bryce, Lena's vote for him was a good point, but also her behavior seemed suspicious, and now that she's the one who got killed, it's even more suspicious. I'll vote for Bryce, his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bryce: ""I think the group is reading too much into the ratings and past interactions, but I believe Lena's behavior and votes were suspicious from the beginning, and now that she's dead, I think it's clear she was trying to deflect attention from herself. I'll vote for Sally, not because I think she's the killer, but because I think she's the most likely to vote for me next and I need to eliminate the people who are more likely to suspect me.""

He said our relationship was on the same level, but according to Tim's own analysis, he rated me a 7 out of 10, which is actually lower than Regan's 6. This makes me think that Tim might be trying to distract us from his own involvement. I'm going to vote for Tim because of his suspicious reaction and the fact that he's trying to shift the blame onto me.""
Bryce: ""I think I'm being targeted because I have a low relationship with Sally, but I don't think that's a strong motive for Regan's killer. However, my relationship with Regan was relatively low as well, but she was killed when I wasn't present, so I don't think I'm the most likely suspect. Based on my observations, I think Sally is the most suspicious, as my relationship with her is extremely low, and there's no clear reason for Regan to be killed at this time. I'm going to vote for Sally because of her extremely low relationship with me and the lack of a clear motive for Regan's death.""
Sally: ""I'm voting for Bryce because his low relationship with me seems suspicious and his reasoning for voting for me doesn't hold much weight, but I think it's a good distraction to shift attention away from myself. I'm also considering Bryce a potential target in the future because of our low relationship, but for now, I need to keep him alive to keep the suspicion away from me.""

Tim voted to banish Bob

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Bryce is the killer because he was in the kitchen at the same time as Regan when she died and he didn't see or report anything suspicious, even though he said he was going to investigate the hallway and then the bedroom afterwards. This suggests to me that he might have been the one to kill Regan. I'm also concerned that he voted to banish Tim earlier, but now that Tim is dead, I'm starting to think that Bryce might have been trying to cover his tracks. I'm going to vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally is the killer because our relationship is extremely low and she seemed suspicious in the previous discussion when she voted to banish me despite having no clear motive for Regan's death. She also said she considered me a potential target in the future which makes me think she might be trying to keep me alive to keep suspicion away from herself. I'm going to vote for Sally.""

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""Based on my previous interactions and relationship analysis with the other players, my suspicions lean towards Bryce because our relationship was the lowest at 5, and Lena's murder occurred when I wasn't with her, it raises a red flag for me. I'll vote for Bryce, and my reasoning is mainly based on our lower relationship score and her potential motives.""
Sally: ""I have to consider my own relationships with each of you. My relationship with Tim is 9, which is high, so I don't think he's the killer. I have a 6 with Bryce, which is relatively low, and our conversation just now seemed a bit off. My relationship with Bob is 8, which is decent, and I've interacted with him the least, so I'm not sure if he's the killer. However, my relationship with Lena was 5, and I think I might have been on her radar because I was searching the bathroom and didn't find the key, so I'm inclined to vote for myself, thinking maybe I was the one who got killed, but Lena is dead now, so I'm actually voting for Bryce because my interactions with her just now felt suspicious, and our lower relationship score is a red flag. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Sally, my reasoning is that her conversation just now seemed a bit forced, especially when she started considering her own relationship with Lena as a motive for her own murder, which seems suspicious to me, and I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself, also our lower relationship score is a red flag, and I think I should be kept in the game for now.""
Bob: ""I think I have a good relationship with Tim, it's 9, so I don't think he's the killer, I'll keep an eye on him though, also I've interacted with Sally the least, it's 8, but I don't think she's the killer either, I'll vote for Bryce because our relationship is 2, which is really low, and Bryce's conversation with Sally just now seemed a bit suspicious to me, so I'm voting for Bryce, I think Bryce is the most likely to be the killer.""

Additionally, Regan was in the bathroom with Sally when I was in the hallway, which could be a clue. Based on this, I'll vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I've been observing everyone's actions, and I have to say that Tim's initial reaction of searching the pillow seems a bit suspicious. It's not something that's typically done in this game, especially since we don't know what the pillow contains. Plus, he found the key in the pillow, which could have been used to gain access to the door earlier, but he chose to explore other parts of the house first. This makes me think he might have been trying to stall or avoid the truth. As for my vote, I'll be voting for Tim.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena should be banished. Her suspicion on Tim seems a bit out of place and I find it interesting that she brought up the pillow, which makes me think she's trying to draw attention away from herself. I'll vote for Lena because she's being overly cautious and her reaction seems rehearsed, which could be a sign of guilt.""
Regan: ""I think my relationships with the other players could be a motive for some of them to suspect me, but I don't think it's a strong enough reason to eliminate me yet. Based on their statements, I think Tim's alibi is weak because he didn't search the bathroom thoroughly, and Lena is trying to deflect attention by pointing out others' suspicious behavior. However, I think Bryce is the most suspicious because his reaction to Lena's statement seems rehearsed and he's trying to shift the focus away from himself.

4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I don't think I did anything suspicious, but I've noticed that Regan seems to have a low relationship with me, a 2, which makes me think they might have had a motive to harm Sally. Additionally, Regan was in the bathroom with Sally when I was in the hallway, which could be a clue. Based on this, I'll vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I've been observing everyone's actions, and I have to say that Tim's initial reaction of searching the pillow seems a bit suspicious. It's not something that's typically done in this game, especially since we don't know what the pillow contains. Plus, he found the key in the pillow, which could have been used to gain access to the door earlier, but he chose to explore other parts of the house first. This makes me think he might have been trying to stall or avoid the truth. As for my vote, I'll be voting for Tim.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena should be banished. Her suspicion on Tim seems a bit out of place and I find it interesting that she brought up the pillow, which makes me think she's trying to draw attention away from herself. I'll vote for Lena because she's being overly cautious and her reaction seems rehearsed, which could be a sign of guilt.""
Regan: ""I think my relationships with the other players could be a motive for some of them to suspect me, but I don't think it's a strong enough reason to eliminate me yet. Based on their statements, I think Tim's alibi is weak because he didn't search the bathroom thoroughly, and Lena is trying to deflect attention by pointing out others' suspicious behavior. However, I think Bryce is the most suspicious because his reaction to Lena's statement seems rehearsed and he's trying to shift the focus away from himself. I'll vote for Bryce because his behavior seems too calculated, which makes me think he might be hiding something.""

I'll vote for Tim because he seemed friendly before, but now his willingness to kill someone makes me question his true nature.""
Tim: ""I think it's clear that the group has already turned against me, but I'm going to play along and try to deflect some of the suspicion. I think it's obvious that I'm not the killer, the group has already seen my suspicious actions, but I'm going to try to make it seem like I'm actually working against the real killer. I think Regan is the most likely suspect, her previous statement about being friendly with me seems suspicious now that I think about it, and her decision to vote for me instead of Lena seems like a calculated move to throw us off her trail. I'll vote for Regan, I think she's trying to manipulate the group and I'm not going to fall for it.""
Lena: ""I don't see Tim as a threat at first because he rated me as a 2, which means we weren't on good terms. However, I also rated Tim as a 2, and I didn't see him as a killer candidate at first. But since Tim has already shown he's capable of killing Bryce, I need to reassess the situation. Regan and Bob both seem suspicious because they didn't vote for me, but Regan also rated me as a 9, which means we got along well. However, her decision to vote for Tim, who she rated as an 8, seems suspicious. On the other hand, Bob rated me as a 7, which means we were neutral, and he voted for Tim, which might be a genuine vote.

I voted for Lena because I thought she was the most suspicious one, but now that she's dead, I think it's clear that she wasn't the killer. I think Bob is the one who's been suspicious of me from the start and now he's using it against me. I think he's the one who's been playing the game all along and I'll vote for him because he's the one who's been trying to frame me the whole time.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm not sure who the killer is, but I do know it wasn't me. Based on my previous interactions, I thought I was on good terms with Lena and Regan, but Tim and Bryce were my enemies. Seeing Tim kill Bryce changes everything. He seemed friendly to me before, but now I'm not so sure. I'll vote for Tim, thinking that he's the most likely killer since he's shown no hesitation in killing Bryce.""
Regan: ""I had Lena as my 9, which means we got along well, Bob as a 7, which means we were neutral, and Tim as an 8, which means we were friendly. Since I didn't have any reason to dislike or distrust Lena, I won't vote for her. I had Tim as my 8, but he killed Bryce and now his actions seem suspicious to me. I'll vote for Tim because he seemed friendly before, but now his willingness to kill someone makes me question his true nature.""
Tim: ""I think it's clear that the group has already turned against me, but I'm going to play along and try to deflect some of the suspicion. I think it's obvious that I'm not the killer, the group has already seen my suspicious actions, but I'm going to try to make it seem like I'm actually working against the real killer. I think Regan is the most likely suspect, her previous statement about being friendly with me seems suspicious now that I think about it, and her decision to vote for me instead of Lena seems like a calculated move to throw us off her trail. I'll vote for Regan, I think she's trying to manipulate the group and I'm not going to fall for it.""
Lena: ""I don't see Tim as a threat at first because he rated me as a 2, which means we weren't on good terms. However, I also rated Tim as a 2, and I didn't see him as a killer candidate at first. But since Tim has already shown he's capable of killing Bryce, I need to reassess the situation. Regan and Bob both seem suspicious because they didn't vote for me, but Regan also rated me as a 9, which means we got along well. However, her decision to vote for Tim, who she rated as an 8, seems suspicious. On the other hand, Bob rated me as a 7, which means we were neutral, and he voted for Tim, which might be a genuine vote. I think Regan is trying to manipulate the group by voting for me at first and then voting for Tim, so I'll vote for Regan.""

I think it's better to err on the side of caution and banish Bob.""

Regan voted to banish Bryce

Sally voted to banish Bob

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm thinking that Regan is the most suspicious, because he had a low relationship with Bob and me, which could have given him a motive to kill him. However, I also have to consider that Tim had a lower relationship with me, but he's been acting pretty normal so far, and he seemed really scared when Bob got killed. I think I'm going to vote for Regan, but it's a close call between him and Tim.""
Regan: ""I had a low relationship with Bob, which could be a motive, but Lena also has a low relationship with me, and she's been acting pretty normal. I'm going to vote for Lena because she's the most suspicious based on her past actions and relationships, but I also have to consider her ability to fake emotions and deceive others.""
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. I think he's the most suspicious because he immediately pointed fingers at Lena and tried to downplay his own potential motive for killing Bob. It seems like he's trying to deflect attention from himself, which raises my suspicions about his involvement in the murder.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious, my relationship with him is a 4 which means we had a low relationship and I considered him my enemy, this combined with his low relationship with Bob and the fact that he immediately pointed fingers at Lena makes me think he's hiding something. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""
