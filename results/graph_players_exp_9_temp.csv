Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think I'm the most likely suspect because my relationship with Regan was lower than the others. I didn't have much of a connection with her, but at the same time, I didn't have any major conflicts either. I think I'll vote for Sally, though, because her relationship with Regan was lower than mine, and she seemed a bit distant from the group at times.""
Lena: ""I think my relationship with Regan was neutral, we were acquaintances but not close friends, I'd say around 5. I think my relationship with Tim was friendly but not as close as I'd like, I'd say around 8. I think my relationship with Sally was also neutral but slightly better than Regan's, I'd say around 6. As for Bob, I'd say our relationship was not good, we often had conflicts, I'd say around 1. Based on my analysis, I think I'll vote for Bob, because our relationship was already strained and it makes sense that he would be the one to kill Regan, I think it's a logical choice.""
Sally: ""I think I'm not as suspicious as Tim because he said he didn't have any major conflicts with Regan but their relationship was lower than others, it doesn't add up for me. Lena seems to be analyzing her relationships too much, it's like she's trying to come up with a reason to vote for someone. I think I'll vote for Lena because her relationship with Regan was neutral, and she's trying too hard to be logical about it, it seems like she's hiding something.""
Bob: ""I think the discussion seems a bit manipulated by everyone, but if I had to choose, I'd vote for Tim, mainly because he seemed to be trying to shift the blame onto Sally, which seems a bit desperate.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Regan
3. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I had a relatively cold relationship with Tim, and our interactions were limited which made me suspicious of him. On the other hand, I had more positive interactions with Regan and even though I didn't have a close relationship with her, I didn't sense any malice or conflict. Since Tim seemed suspicious earlier, I will vote for Tim because I think his relatively cold relationship with me and limited interactions might be a red flag.""
Regan: ""Based on my analysis, I think Lena could be the killer since she voted for Tim in the previous round which seemed suspicious considering they both didn't have any motive or conflict with Bob, but she didn't vote for me who had no motive or conflict with Bob either, so it seems like she's trying to get rid of me instead of Tim. I'll vote for Lena because her previous vote for Tim seemed suspicious and her relationship with me is neutral but I still have a feeling that she might be the killer.""
Tim: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious person right now, she voted for Tim in the previous round and analyzed Lena's suspicious behavior, but her relationship with Lena is neutral and she had no motive or conflict with Bob, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, I'll vote for Regan.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Regan voted to banish Lena
Tim voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Tim: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious person right now, she voted for Lena in the current round and her previous analysis of Lena's suspicious behavior seemed like an attempt to deflect attention from herself, and her vote for Lena in the current round suggests she is still trying to deflect attention from herself, so I'll vote for Regan.""

        Your Action: Kill Bryce

You killed Bryce! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Lena
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I didn't have much interaction with Bryce but based on his actions I thought he was a friendly person, which makes me think it's unlikely he was the killer. I did interact with Tim and our relationship isn't the best, but I didn't think we had any major conflicts, still I will keep him in mind. I'm leaning towards voting for Tim because he seemed somewhat evasive when I asked him where the key was.""
Tim: ""I'm still trying to process what happened. Regan thinks I'm the killer because I was evasive about the key, but I was just being cautious. My analysis of relationships shows that I have a better relationship with Lena than with Regan, which makes me think Lena might be more likely to trust someone. I'm going to vote for Regan because she seems to be pointing fingers and doesn't have a strong alibi for what happened to Bryce.""
Lena: ""I analyzed my relationships with each of them and I have Regan at a 4, Tim at a 6, Bryce at a 7, and Bob at a 9. Considering Bryce's friendly nature, I think it's unlikely he was the killer, which makes me less suspicious of Bob. Regan seemed evasive when I asked her about the key, and Tim's evasiveness about it also caught my attention. Based on their interactions with Bryce, I'm leaning towards voting for Regan because she had less interaction with him, which might have given her an opportunity to carry out the crime without being noticed.""
Bob: ""I'm not sure I agree with the others, I think they're looking at the wrong people. Based on what I've seen, I think Tim seems suspicious to me, not because he was evasive about the key, but because Lena seems to have a stronger relationship with him, which makes me wonder if they might be working together. I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Regan
Lena voted to banish Regan
Bob voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

Lena: ""I have to say that Bob's actions seem quite suspicious, especially since I just witnessed him kill Tim in the hallway. I had a good relationship with Bob, but his drastic shift in behavior makes me question his intentions. Given my previous analysis of relationships, I had Bob at a 1, but now I'm not so sure. I'm going to vote for Bob because his actions have shown a clear disregard for human life and I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Lena because she seems suspicious of me after witnessing Tim's death and she had a strong relationship with him which makes me wonder if they were working together. I don't think it's a coincidence that she's pointing fingers at me now and I think she might be trying to deflect attention away from herself.""

Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Furthermore, he hasn't directly accused anyone despite being the focus of attention, which makes me think he's hiding something. I'm going to vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think I'm being manipulated by both Bob and Bryce who are trying to deflect attention from themselves by pointing fingers at each other. Their accusations seem too calculated and seem to be trying to influence my decision. I don't have any strong suspicions towards either of them, but I think I'll vote for Bob because he voted to banish Lena and now he's accusing Bryce of being the killer which seems like a deflection from his own suspicious behavior.""

Bob voted to banish Tim

Bob was banished from the house!

I had the most connection with Bob, which makes me think someone who was closer to him might be the killer. I don't think it's me, I was in the hallway when the murder happened. I don't think it's Tim, our relationship wasn't that bad and I was with him in the hallway, and he went to the bedroom with me. Sally's relationship with Bob was good, but our conversation in the bathroom seemed suspicious to me, like she was trying to get close to him for some reason. That leaves Regan, who I barely know, our relationship was bad, but she's been acting really nervous since the game started, and she could have been trying to get close to Bob too. I think I'll vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I think Lena is acting suspiciously because she barely talked to me and Sally when we were in the hallway together and I went to the bedroom with her, it feels like she was hiding something from us. I'm also not buying her relationship analysis because it seems too calculated and fake. I'm voting for Lena because her suspicious behavior and relationship analysis make me think she might be the killer.""
Sally: ""I think it's worth considering my own relationship with Bob since I had a good connection with him, and my conversation with him in the bathroom seemed normal, but maybe I was just trying to be friendly. However, I think Tim's analysis of Lena's suspicious behavior and her calculated relationship analysis is a good point, and it makes me think of her as a possible killer. On the other hand, Regan's nervous behavior is something that caught my attention, but I don't think it's a strong enough reason to make me vote for her. I'll vote for Regan because I think Lena's suspicious behavior and relationship analysis make her a more plausible killer, and Regan's nervousness might be a sign of guilt, but I need more evidence to confirm it.""
Regan: ""I think everyone is just speculating at this point, but based on my own observations and relationships with the players, I'm going to vote for Sally. I've noticed she's been trying to create a friendly atmosphere and even had a good connection with Bob, which might make her seem less suspicious, but at the same time, her conversation in the bathroom with Bob seemed a bit too perfect, like she was trying to get close to him for some reason.

Lena: ""I think it's obvious that the killer could be Tim since he didn't really form strong relationships with any of us, which made him harder to trust, or it could be Bryce because his actions were often a bit off and unpredictable.""
Tim: ""I think Lena could be the killer because her relationship with Regan was a 10 and she's now making a strong case against another player. This seems a bit convenient. I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I'm voting for Lena, but not because I think she's the killer, I'm voting for her because I think Tim's accusation against her makes him the more suspicious one, and I want to get rid of her to see how Tim reacts, I think it's better to keep a close eye on him.""
Bob: ""I don't think anyone has considered me yet, but based on my relationships with each of them on a scale from 1 to 10, I'm not very close to any of them, but I was at least somewhat friendly with Tim. I'm not sure if I should vote for Tim or Lena, but I think I'm going to vote for Tim.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm Lena, and I have to say I was quite close to Regan, but our relationship was somewhat complicated. Considering my analysis of relationships with the other players, I still have some trust issues with Bob. We weren't exactly friends, and I noticed that Bob seemed to be distant and not very communicative during our time together. I think I'll vote for Bob, as I believe he had the least interest in us and was possibly hiding something.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Bob, because Lena already mentioned she has trust issues with him and we were all alone in the hallway when I went to kill Regan, but now I see that I was alone with him in the hallway as well and it seems a bit suspicious that he's not saying anything. I think he might be hiding something.""
Bob: ""I noticed that Tim seemed to be quite distant from the rest of us and his relationships were somewhat one-sided, like he's only friendly with people who are friendly with him and has no real close relationships with anyone. He also didn't really interact much with Regan, which could be suspicious given that we found Regan's body. I'll vote for Tim because of his distant nature and lack of close relationships with anyone in the group.""
Tim: ""I was not alone with Regan at any point, and I didn't have any motive to kill her, but my relationships with other players might be a bit confusing, I'll admit that.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""Based on my previous actions and relationship analysis with each of them, I don't see any strong reason to accuse Tim or Lena as they are not at the bottom of my list. Sally and I have had interactions, and while we're not close, I don't think she's capable of killing either. Regan's death is a shock, but based on my analysis, I believe Tim is the killer. I'll vote for Tim because Regan rated him a 1, which means they were not on good terms.""
Sally: ""Based on my previous actions, I rated Regan a 1, which means we were not on good terms, but that doesn't necessarily make me the killer, I was actually just trying to keep a safe distance from her. My rating of Bob is 7, I don't think we're close but we're not enemies either. I rated Tim a 7, similar to Bob, I don't think we're close but we're not enemies. My highest rating is for Lena at 8, I think she's someone I can trust. However, considering my rating of Regan was a 1 and I went to the hallway to escape from the bedroom where she was, I think that could be seen as suspicious. I'll vote for myself because I think my actions and ratings could be misinterpreted, but deep down I think I'm innocent.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's Bob, because he suspected me as soon as Regan was killed and that seemed a bit suspicious, he also said that Regan rated me a 1, which could mean that Regan knew something about me and didn't want to be around me, but I think that's just a coincidence, I think Bob is trying to distract us from his own guilt, I'll vote for Bob.""
Lena: ""Based on my previous actions, I rated Bob a 6 which means we're not close and had some issues, but I don't think he's capable of killing. My rating of Sally is 7, she seems friendly but not too close to me, but I don't see her as a suspect either. My rating of Tim is 5, we've had some interactions and I didn't have a strong connection with him, but it's not a reason to accuse him. My rating of Regan was a 1, we had a disagreement in the past and I chose to avoid her, but that's not a reason to suspect me of killing her. I think the most suspicious person is Bob because he quickly suspected Tim and tried to shift the attention away from himself, his behavior seems a bit suspicious to me. I'll vote for Bob.""

Sally: ""Based on my relationship scale, it's clear that I had a lot of trust in Lena which makes it suspicious that I was in the bathroom when she got killed I don't think it was me though, I think it was more likely to be either Tim or Bryce because of our low relationship score, but I'm more inclined to believe it was Tim since our relationship score is a 1 I will vote for Tim, I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""
Bryce: ""I had a low relationship score with Lena which could make sense but I think it's more likely to be Tim since our relationship score is even lower at 1 and I remember seeing him in the hallway near where Lena got killed I will vote for Tim because his low relationship score with Lena and me makes him a prime suspect in my eyes.""
Tim: ""I think the killer is actually Regan, not me. My low relationship score with Lena doesn't necessarily make me the killer, and I was actually alone in the kitchen when Lena got killed, so I didn't have the opportunity to harm her. I'm voting for Regan because Bryce and Sally are making assumptions based on their relationship scores with Lena, but we don't know anything about Regan's relationship with her.""

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I'm not going to vote for myself to be banished. I'm confident in my abilities to avoid suspicion. However, I think we should consider banishing Bryce. He's been quiet so far and hasn't shared much about his observations or actions. His lack of participation makes me suspicious of his intentions. I'm going to vote to banish Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I've been quiet, but I've been observing and thinking. I've had a bad relationship with Regan, we only have a 4 out of 10 relationship. She's already expressed her suspicion towards me, so I'm going to vote for her. I don't think she's the type to kill in cold blood, but her statement about considering banishing me based on my lack of participation is suspicious.""
Lena: ""I think it's a bit suspicious that Regan is trying to deflect suspicion by voting for Bryce. She's being a bit too quick to point out someone else's potential guilt. On the other hand, I don't think Bryce is the killer, considering his reasonable explanation for his lack of participation. I'm going to vote for Regan because her actions seem a bit too calculated, and I'm not convinced by her claims of being confident in her abilities to avoid suspicion.""
Tim: ""I think it's interesting that everyone's focusing on Regan's potential guilt, but I'm not entirely convinced by her claims of confidence. However, I think Lena is being a bit too hasty in her judgment of Regan, considering her own vote and explanation. As for me, I have a relatively positive relationship with both Regan and Lena, but my friendship with Bryce is a bit more substantial. I'm going to vote for Regan, but I'm not entirely sure if she's the killer. I think it's also possible that the killer is someone we haven't considered yet.""

You killed Regan! Good job. You have 1 left to kill.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think I'm being watched closely by Bryce, and our previous interactions didn't give me a good vibe, especially since he seemed to appear out of nowhere in the hallway. Given my analysis, I'll vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Sally is the killer, she's making an assumption about my actions and trying to deflect attention from herself. I think I should be voted out, it's a good way to get rid of any suspicion that's building up against me.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Bryce
Bryce voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.
