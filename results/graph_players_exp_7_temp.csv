Bob: ""I don't think it's fair to accuse someone based on their actions alone, we all moved around the house and changed locations at some point. I've been paying attention to everyone's actions and I think Regan's behavior is suspicious, but I also think Lena is hiding something. I'll vote for Regan because I think she's the most suspicious one in the room right now.""
Tim: ""I think I'll vote for Bob because he seemed hesitant in accusing Regan, but then quickly jumped to blaming Regan. I think that's a pretty suspicious behavior, especially when he was trying to shift the attention away from himself. It's possible that Bob is trying to deflect suspicion and play the victim, but I think he's actually hiding something. I'll keep an eye on him, but for now, I think Bob is the most suspicious one in the room.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Lena
Bob voted to banish Regan
Tim voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Tim is acting suspiciously, he quickly jumped to blaming Bob without considering the possibility that Bob was trying to throw him off his scent, and then he tried to shift the attention away from himself by accusing Bob of being the killer. I think that's a pretty suspicious behavior, and I'm going to vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think Lena is acting suspiciously because she accused Regan first without enough evidence, and now she's accusing me without considering that I might be innocent. I'll vote for Lena because she seems to be targeting others without a clear motive, and I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Lena
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

I'm going to vote to banish Bob.""
Bob: ""I think it's unfair that Tim is targeting Bryce without any solid evidence, and I think Sally's reasoning for voting for me seems a bit far-fetched since I didn't leave the bathroom that I was in and I think she's just trying to deflect attention from her own possible involvement or from Tim's actual guilt since he was alone in the bedroom where the body was initially found and no one saw him move, that's a pretty suspicious situation, I'm going to vote to banish Tim because I don't think he's being entirely truthful about his alibi.""
Bryce: ""I think we're all focusing on the wrong people, it's too early to make accusations, I'm going to vote to banish Sally because she jumped straight to conclusions without gathering any solid evidence, her accusation of Bob seems like a desperate attempt to deflect attention and her voting for Bob without questioning him further seems like a poor judgment.""
