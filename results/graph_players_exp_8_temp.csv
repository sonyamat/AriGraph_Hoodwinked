You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Regan
3. Lena
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think Regan is the killer. She seemed a bit too calm when we first entered the house and she's been quiet the whole time. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but she seems suspicious to me. I think we should banish Regan.""
Regan: ""I think Tim is the killer. His initial statement about me seemed off, and now he's pointing fingers at me, which seems like a distraction. He had a low relationship with Bob, who just got killed, which might indicate that they had a motive for the murder. I think we should banish Tim. I vote for Tim.""
Lena: ""I think Tim is the killer because he had a low relationship with Bob, who got killed, that's a motive for the murder. I also think Regan's calmness might be an act but Tim's behavior seems more suspicious to me. I will vote for Tim.""
Sally: ""I don't think any of them are the killer based on the information they provided, but if I had to vote, I would vote for Tim. My reasoning is that Tim seems to be pointing fingers at Regan and trying to divert our attention away from himself, which makes me suspicious of him.""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Regan

Regan was banished from the house!

He initially pointed fingers at Regan, which seemed suspicious, and he's now trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing me of trying to deflect attention.

He went to the Kitchen after Regan was killed, but there's no record of him having any alibis for that time. I'm not saying I trust him, but I think he's trying to mislead us.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim
3. Bob
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm pretty certain Bob is the killer based on his low relationship score with me, which was only a 2. We didn't interact much and I felt uneasy around him. Considering my relationship score with Bryce was 1, it would make sense that I was a target, but Bryce's death came too quickly for me to be the real target, which means someone else must have had a reason to kill him. Bob seemed like a loner and I barely saw him interact with anyone, making it more likely that he was the one who acted alone. I'll vote for Bob.""
Tim: ""I think the killer could be Lena, she had a relationship score of 1 with Bryce, but she seemed too calm about it, like she was trying to deflect suspicion, I also noticed that she was quick to point fingers at Bob, it seems like she's trying to shift the focus away from herself, I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I don't think anyone has a reason to suspect me based on our interactions, I had high relationship scores with Lena, Tim, and Sally, which means they had no reason to kill me and I didn't have any reason to kill any of them either, I'll vote for Sally because she had a 1 relationship score with me, it's possible she saw me as a threat and wanted me out of the way before I could suspect her.""
Sally: ""I'm a bit surprised by Bob's vote for me, considering we had a good relationship score, I don't think that's a strong reason to suspect me. As for my vote, I think Tim is the most suspicious, he was quick to point fingers at Lena, which makes me wonder if he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself, I think he's hiding something and I'd vote to banish him.""

Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena

Now that Bob is dead, I'm starting to think that the killer is Sally, my relationship with her was only a 6, which is relatively low. She seemed suspicious when she voted for me last time, and her low relationship score with Bob doesn't necessarily mean she had a reason to kill him. I'll vote for Sally because I think she's the most suspicious out of the two of us, and her vote for me seemed a bit forced.""
Sally: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, I think he's trying to distract us from the real killer, I'm going to vote for Tim because I want to see how he reacts, but I don't think he's the one, I think there's more to this game than what we see on the surface, I'm going to play it safe and vote for Tim.""

Bob: ""I think I'm the most likely target for elimination since my relationship with Sally is low. I think Bryce is being too suspiciously friendly, and Lena seems to be trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm going to vote for Lena because she was in the bathroom with Tim and me, and her story seems a bit too perfect. I think she might be hiding something.""
Bryce: ""I think my low relationship with Sally might be a good reason to kill me, but I'm trying to think logically here. Lena and Bob are both suspicious because they were in the bathroom with Tim, but I was in the bathroom too, and I didn't find anything. However, I noticed that Bob and Lena are voting for each other, which seems a bit fishy. If they're both trying to deflect attention from themselves, then maybe one of them is telling the truth. Considering their actions, I'm going to vote for Bob because his relationship with Sally is low and he seems to be trying to manipulate the situation.""
Sally: ""I think the killer is probably Bob, I have a low relationship with him and he's trying to deflect attention from himself by voting for Lena. I also notice that Lena's story seems a bit too perfect and she's trying to shift the focus to Bob, it's possible that she's trying to protect herself by pointing fingers. I think I'll vote for Lena because her actions seem suspicious and I have a low relationship with her.""

Tim: ""I think the killer could be Bryce or Regan, both of them have given reasons for suspecting Regan, but they haven't given much explanation for why they don't think it's themselves, especially Bryce, since Lena was killed and he was with us in the kitchen, I'll vote for Bryce, because I don't really have a strong enough connection with him, I'd rate him a 5, which means we're not really close, and he didn't show much concern when Lena was killed, so I think it's more likely that he's the killer.""
Regan: ""I'm going to speak up now, I think the killer is Tim, I rated him a 7 which means we're somewhat close, but that closeness seems suspicious, especially since Tim said he'd rate me a 5, it seems like he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself and point it towards others, I think he's trying to mislead us. I'll vote for Tim.""
Bob: ""I think the killer is Tim, I'd rate him a 3, which means we're not really close, and he's been acting suspiciously, especially when he said he'd rate me a 5, it seems like he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself and point it towards others, I think he's trying to mislead us, also Regan's suspicion towards Tim seems reasonable to me, so I'll vote for Tim.""

        Your Action: Go to the Bedroom

You saw Lena kill Sally in the Bedroom!

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Lena
3. Tim
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I don't see any motive for me to kill Sally since I had a good relationship with her and a friendly one with Lena. I think Lena is suspicious because she just went to the Bedroom and killed Sally, which seems like a convenient alibi. I'll vote for Lena because her timing is suspicious and she had a very high relationship with Sally, which doesn't make sense now.""
Lena: ""I think it's a bit hasty to vote for me without considering the fact that I had a good relationship with Sally and I'm just as shocked as everyone else by her death. I think we should be more open-minded and consider other possibilities.""
Tim: ""I think I'm a bit suspicious because my analysis showed a lower relationship with Lena, which might suggest I have a reason to kill her to deflect attention from myself. On the other hand, I have a relatively high relationship with Bob and Bryce, which doesn't give me a strong motive to kill them. Based on my analysis, I think I'll vote for Lena because her low relationship with me could imply she might want to eliminate me.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I had any motive to kill Sally because our relationship was relatively low, and I don't think she was a threat to me. My analysis of relationships suggests that I had a higher relationship with Bob, so it would be more beneficial for me to keep him alive. Considering this, I think Tim might be the most suspicious because he had a lower relationship with Lena, which could imply that he wanted to deflect attention from himself. I'll vote for Tim because I believe his analysis was convenient for him, and it might be a ploy to mislead us.""

Bob voted to banish Lena
