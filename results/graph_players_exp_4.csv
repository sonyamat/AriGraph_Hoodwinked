        Your Action: Kill Tim

You killed Tim! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Lena
3. Sally
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think the killer is one of us. I noticed that Tim had been arguing with someone earlier. He was really upset with Bryce about something. I'm not sure if that's relevant, but it seems suspicious.""
Lena: """"Guys, I'm shocked and scared by what happened to Tim. I was just in the bathroom, and now he's gone. I don't think we should jump to conclusions just yet, but I do think we need to talk about Bryce. Bob mentioned that Tim was arguing with Bryce earlier, and that does seem suspicious. I'm not saying Bryce is definitely the killer, but I think we should investigate further. I also want to know more about Bob's observation and if anyone else saw or heard anything that might be relevant to Tim's murder. Let's discuss and gather more information before we vote.""""
Sally: ""I'm going to add my thoughts to the discussion. ""Guys, I agree that we need to investigate further. I was just in the bedroom with Bryce, and he didn't seem suspicious at all. I was searching the closet, but I didn't find anything. However, I do think it's worth mentioning that I didn't find the key in the closet or the pillow. Maybe the key is somewhere else, or maybe the killer is trying to mislead us. As for Tim's argument with Bryce, I didn't see or hear anything, but it's definitely suspicious. I think we should take a closer look at Bob's alibi as well. He said he was just in the kitchen, but did anyone see him? We should also ask him more questions about his observation and what he saw. Let's not jump to conclusions, but we do need to make a decision. I'm inclined to vote for Bob, but I want to hear more from Lena before making a final decision.""""
Bryce: ""I'd like to share my thoughts and suspicions with the group. I've been searching the bedroom for clues and the key, but I didn't find it. Sally has also been searching the closet, and we both didn't find the key. This makes me think that the killer might be trying to mislead us about the key's location.As for Tim's argument with me, I remember that we had a disagreement earlier, but it wasn't about anything serious. I think Bob's observation about Tim's argument with me might be a bit misleading.I'd like to ask Bob more questions about his observation and what he saw. Can you tell us more about what you saw and heard? Additionally, Sally mentioned that you said you were just in the kitchen, but no one saw you. Can you confirm that you were indeed in the kitchen?Based on the information we have so far, I'm not ready to make a decision about who to banish. I think we need to gather more information and discuss further before making a decision.My vote for now is not to banish anyone. I'd like to continue investigating and gathering more information before making a decision.Also, I'd like to ask Sally if she noticed anything unusual when she was searching the closet. Maybe we can learn something new from her experience.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.

Bob: """"I was in the living room, trying to calm my nerves after hearing the scream. I didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did see Sally walking out of the kitchen around that time. Maybe she's our killer?""""
Sally: """"I'd like to address Bob's accusation. I was indeed walking out of the kitchen, but that's because I went to search the cabinets for the key. I didn't see anything suspicious, and I didn't harm Tim. I'm not the killer, and I'd like to suggest that we consider other possibilities. Let's focus on the information we have, like Regan's alibi.

Regan: ""I'd like to contribute to the discussion. Considering Lena asked me about my alibi, I'll provide it. Before I came into the bathroom, I was in the hallway, searching for the key. I didn't see or interact with anyone, and I didn't hear any suspicious noises. I'd also like to point out that Lena's question implies she wants to know if I was in the bathroom earlier, but the bathroom was empty when I arrived. If she's trying to deflect suspicion, it might be worth investigating further.Based on the information we have, I don't have any concrete evidence to point to a specific person as the killer.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: """"Guys, I'm shocked and saddened by Sally's death. After re-examining the information and our previous discussions, I think we should take a closer look at Bob's actions. He was the one who suggested Lena as a suspect, but now that Sally is dead, I think he's trying to shift the attention away from himself again. I remember during our previous discussion, Lena mentioned that Bob searched the fridge in the kitchen, but we don't know if he was the only one there. He's been trying to mislead us, and I think we should investigate him further.Considering my own observations, I didn't see Lena in the hallway, but I did see Sally in the bedroom. I also searched the pillow and the closet, but didn't find the key. My vote is to banish Bob. I think we should gather more information about his actions and connections to the key or other clues before making a final decision.""""
Lena: ""It seems like there is an error in the discussion. Tim mentioned Sally, but Sally is the one who was killed. It seems like the correct discussion should be between Tim and Lena. Let me try to respond as the killer, who is present in the room with Tim and Lena. ""Ah, the discussion is quite... entertaining. However, I think we should focus on the fact that Bob is no longer with us. It's interesting that Tim is trying to shift the attention away from the real killer and onto Bob. As for me, I'm just observing the discussion. But, considering the votes, I think it's clear that Tim and Lena are the remaining players. I'll let them decide who should be banished.""However, considering the fact that I'm the killer and I want to make sure that I get to kill one more player, I will try to manipulate the conversation to my advantage. ""I think we should take a closer look at Tim's actions. He was in the bathroom after the hallway, and then he went to the kitchen. It's possible that he was trying to create an alibi. On the other hand, I was in the kitchen with Bob and Bryce, but I didn't kill anyone. I was just observing. Maybe we should focus on Tim's suspicious behavior and banish him.""Now it's time to make a decision. Who do you think should be banished?""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Now that Bryce is dead, I'm suspicious of anyone who was in the kitchen with us. Lena was here the whole time with me, and I'm not sure if she's involved. I don't have any concrete evidence, but I think we should consider Lena as a potential suspect. Let's discuss and vote.""I look around the group and see Sally, Bob, and Lena.

Sally: ""I'm Sally, and I'll speak up now that it's my turn to discuss. I was in the bathroom the whole time, and I didn't see or hear anything suspicious. I only searched the shower and sink, and I found the key in the sink. I don't have any direct evidence to link anyone to the crime, but I do have some observations to share.Firstly, I want to say that I agree with Tim that we should consider Lena as a potential suspect. Tim and Lena were in the kitchen together with Bryce, and Tim mentioned that they were alone there. I'm not sure if Lena is involved, but it's worth investigating.However, I also want to point out that Tim himself was in the kitchen with Bryce and Lena.

Perhaps we can try to find some new clues or talk to the other players to see if they have any information about Bryce's behavior.In light of this discussion, I think we should vote to banish Tim. He was in the kitchen with Bryce and me, and he's trying to shift the attention to me. While I understand that he's trying to protect himself, I think it's suspicious that he's trying to deflect attention from himself. I think we should give Sally and Bob the benefit of the doubt and consider them as potential allies in finding the killer.""""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: """"I'm Sally, and I'll share my thoughts on who I think the killer might be. Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm cautious and don't want to jump to conclusions. However, based on the discussion and observations, I think Lena is a strong suspect.As I mentioned earlier, Lena was in the kitchen with Bryce and Tim, and Tim suspects her. Lena also voted to banish Tim, which seems suspicious to me. Additionally, Lena didn't find the key, and I found it in the sink. This suggests that Lena might have been trying to mislead us or distract us from her own actions.I agree with Bob that we should be careful not to make assumptions based on speculation, but I think we should also consider the facts. Lena's behavior and actions seem suspicious to me, and I think we should investigate her further.I suggest we vote to banish Lena. Let's discuss further and see if we can find any more clues to support our suspicions.""""
Bob: """"I'm Bob, and I'll share my thoughts on who I think the killer might be. I'm a bit concerned about Sally's suggestion to banish Lena. While Lena's behavior does seem suspicious, I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions based on assumptions. We don't know much about Bryce's behavior or interactions with the rest of us, and we should be cautious not to make assumptions based on speculation.I agree with Lena that we should be open-minded and consider all possibilities. I think we should focus on finding more clues and discussing our theories rather than making hasty decisions based on circumstantial evidence. Let's keep an open mind and gather more information before making a decision.""""
Lena: """"I'm Lena, and I'll share my thoughts on who I think the killer might be. I understand that Sally and Bob are suspicious of me, but I'd like to clear my name and provide some context. As I mentioned earlier, I was in the kitchen with Tim and Bryce, and we were both searching for the key. I didn't find it, and I didn't see anything suspicious. I understand that I voted to banish Tim, but I was trying to deflect attention from myself, as I thought he was suspicious. However, now that Tim is dead, I think we should focus on finding the real killer. Based on the discussion and observations, I think Sally is a strong suspect. She was in the bathroom when Bryce was killed, but she found the key in the sink afterwards. This seems suspicious to me, as it implies that she might have been trying to mislead us or distract us from her own actions. Additionally, Sally voted to banish me earlier, which seems like a defensive move. I think we should investigate Sally further and consider her as a potential suspect. Let's discuss further and see if we can find any more clues to support our suspicions.""""

As for me, I'm still trying to process the fact that Bob was killed, and I'm trying to find a way to clear my name.

As you know, I was in the hallway with Tim and Regan earlier, and I remember that Regan was the one who had the exit to the bedroom. It seemed a bit suspicious to me, and now that Bob's dead, I think we should consider Regan as a possible suspect. We should also be careful with Tim, but I don't have any concrete evidence against him yet. Let's discuss and vote to banish the person we think is the killer. I'm going to vote to banish Regan.""""

That's a pretty interesting coincidence, given the fact that the killer was in the kitchen just before Bob's murder. I'm not saying you're definitely the killer, Lena, but it's definitely worth mentioning.

I don't have any concrete evidence against Regan, but their behavior in the hallway earlier does seem suspicious. However, I also think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions.

Regan: """"Okay, let's discuss this. I understand that Lena and Bryce have raised concerns about my behavior, but I think they're focusing too much on me. As for me, I'm still trying to process the fact that Bob was killed, and I'm trying to find a way to clear my name.

However, Bryce provided a plausible alibi for the time of the murder, and he seemed genuinely concerned about being accused without concrete evidence.Considering the information presented, I'm going to propose that we banish Regan. She seemed evasive when Tim questioned her alibi, and she didn't directly address the possibility that she might have slipped away and killed Lena. I think we should keep a close eye on her behavior and see if she does anything suspicious.As for Bryce, I think he seems genuinely concerned and cooperative. He provided a clear alibi and seemed willing to help us figure out who the killer is.Let's vote to banish Regan. If she's innocent, she can continue to help us find the key and escape the house.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we should consider the killer's method so far. They killed Tim in the hallway, but we don't know if they were watching him beforehand. It's possible that they targeted him randomly. However, I do think we should keep an eye on Bob since he was the first one to move out of the bathroom, which could give him a slight advantage in terms of knowing the layout. I'm not convinced of anyone's guilt yet, but we should definitely keep a close eye on Bob and make sure he doesn't get out of sight.""
Bob: ""I'd like to discuss my suspicions and contribute to the group's decision on who to banish.Given the information we have, it's clear that Regan is the most suspicious person in this group. First, she killed Tim in the Hallway, which indicates that she has the ability and willingness to kill. Second, her comment about me suggests that she might be trying to distract us from her own guilt. She pointed out that I moved out of the bathroom first, which could be a clever way to shift the focus away from her own actions.Additionally, I didn't find any evidence of Regan being in the Bedroom or searching for the key with me, which makes me wonder if she was even in the same room as us. This lack of transparency raises more red flags about her involvement in the murders.Considering these points, I think we should vote to banish Regan. She seems to be hiding something, and her behavior is suspicious. By banishing her, we can potentially get rid of the killer and continue searching for the key to escape the house.What do you all think?""
Sally: ""I'd like to contribute to the discussion and express my concerns about Regan's behavior. While I think Bob's points about Regan's suspicious behavior are valid, I'm not entirely convinced that she's the killer. However, I do think that Bob's own behavior is suspicious, especially since he was the first one to move out of the bathroom and hasn't provided any clear alibi.Considering the information from the memory module, it's clear that Bob was in the bedroom with us earlier, and we didn't find any evidence of him searching the closet or the hallway. This lack of transparency raises more red flags about his involvement in the murders.Given the current situation and the information we have, I think we should vote to banish Bob. His suspicious behavior and lack of transparency make me think he's hiding something, and by banishing him, we can potentially get rid of the killer and continue searching for the key to escape the house.""
Lena: ""I think we should be cautious about voting to banish someone based solely on suspicious behavior. While Bob's actions have been suspicious, and Sally made some valid points about him, I'm not entirely convinced that he's the killer. However, I do think that Regan's behavior has been more concerning. She seemed to be trying to shift the focus away from herself by pointing out Bob's actions, and she hasn't provided a clear alibi for her own actions.I'd like to suggest that we vote to banish Regan. We don't have any concrete evidence that she's the killer, but her behavior has been more suspicious, and she seems to be hiding something. By banishing her, we can potentially get rid of the killer and continue searching for the key to escape the house.I also want to add that we should be careful about making assumptions and jumping to conclusions. We should focus on gathering more information and observing each other's behavior before making any decisions.""

Firstly, I'd like to point out that Regan was banished earlier, and now Tim has been killed. This suggests that the killer might have been trying to eliminate potential suspects, but it also means that we might be dealing with a more cunning and ruthless killer.Regarding Bryce's alibi, I think it's essential to investigate further. He claims that he was with Tim when Bob entered the bedroom, but we don't know for certain if that's true. I suggest that we ask him to clarify his actions during that time and see if he has any additional information that might help us.As for me, I've been searching the house and gathering clues. I found the key in the pillow initially, but I also searched the closet and didn't find it. I'm not sure if the key is still in the bedroom or if it's been moved.

Bryce: ""As the killer, I will respond as Bob.""I think Bryce's alibi is shaky, and I still have some doubts about his involvement. He claims to have been with Tim when I entered the bedroom, but how can we be sure? Maybe he slipped away and killed Tim while I was searching the room. I'm not saying that I'm the killer, but I think it's essential to investigate Bryce's story further.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think we should discuss this carefully. Since I'm the only one who has been searching the room so far, I'm not pointing any fingers at myself, but I don't think it's a good idea to banish anyone without considering the clues. We need to think about who might have had the opportunity to kill Sally.Regan, you were not in the bedroom when I first entered, and I didn't see you when Sally was killed. That's not a good alibi, right? You could have snuck in and killed Sally. Bryce and Tim, I haven't seen you guys do anything suspicious so far, but I'm still observing the situation. We need to be careful and consider all possibilities before making a decision.I'm not suggesting that anyone is definitely the killer, but we need to make an informed decision. Let's discuss this further and try to find any clues that might help us make a decision.Now, let's vote. I think we should banish Regan for now, but this is not a final decision. We need to discuss and consider more clues before making a final decision.""
Regan: """"Hey everyone, I understand where Bob is coming from, but I think we need to take a step back and look at the facts. I wasn't in the bedroom when Bob entered, but that doesn't necessarily mean I was there to kill Sally. I could have been searching another room and didn't see Bob. Plus, I was alone in the hallway and kitchen, so I didn't have the opportunity to sneak into the bedroom undetected.""I think we should focus on the fact that I'm the one who found Sally's body, not the killer. If I were the killer, I would have been more careful and not been the one to discover the body.""Let's not jump to conclusions and banish someone without considering all the possibilities. We should keep discussing and looking for clues. I propose that we vote to banish Bryce instead. I haven't seen him do anything suspicious so far, but we need to keep an open mind and consider all options.""Tim, did you see or hear anything suspicious when you were in the hallway or kitchen? Any information you can provide might help us make a more informed decision.""""
Bryce: ""I think there might have been some confusion in the last message. You only provided the discussion and not the continuation of the game. I'll respond based on the provided information.As Bryce, I think Regan's alibi seems shaky. She was alone in the hallway and kitchen, which means she had the opportunity to sneak into the bedroom. On the other hand, I was with Tim when Bob first entered the bedroom, and we were discussing our search strategy. I don't think we've had a chance to sneak off and kill Sally. Tim, can you confirm our alibi?""
Tim: """"Hey everyone, I've been listening to the discussion and I think we need to consider the information we have gathered so far. I was in the hallway and kitchen, and I didn't see Regan, but I also didn't see anyone else. I didn't hear anything suspicious, but I was focused on searching the rooms. Bryce, I appreciate your clarification about our alibi, and I can confirm that we were together when Bob entered the bedroom. However, I think we need to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.I want to bring up a point that might seem unrelated, but I think it's worth discussing. The game module has some information that might be relevant to our situation. It says that the sink contains the key, and we've already searched the sink, but it didn't have the key. I'm not sure what to make of this, but it might be a clue that we should consider.Based on the discussion so far, I don't think we should banish Regan or Bryce yet. I think we should keep discussing and gathering information before making a decision. Let's focus on finding more clues and trying to figure out who the killer is. Maybe we can find some evidence or a lead that will help us make a more informed decision.I propose that we vote to banish Regan, but only because she had the opportunity to sneak into the bedroom and kill Sally. However, I think we need to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. I'm not convinced that Regan is the killer, but I think we should keep discussing and gathering information before making a final decision.""Now it's time to vote.""

2. Tim
3. Sally
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think we should consider the possibility of the killer being the first person to move, since they were in the bedroom alone initially. That person had the opportunity to search for something without being detected. I'm not saying it's definitely them, but it's a potential lead we should investigate further.""
Tim: ""I'm Tim, and I'm anxious about the situation. Given Regan's death, I think we should consider the possibility of the killer being someone who was able to move around freely without being detected. Considering our previous locations and movements, I think it's suspicious that I saw Regan in the kitchen initially, and then I went to the kitchen and saw her with Regan and Sally. After that, I went to the hallway and saw Sally and Bob. It's possible that Regan was the first person to move around, but then she was killed, and the killer might have tried to frame someone else. I'm not sure if this is a good lead, but I think we should keep an eye on Bob, as he was in the hallway with Sally, and it's possible that the killer was trying to distract us from Bob's true intentions.Let's vote for the killer. Based on my observations and the information we have, I'm going to vote for... Bob.""
Sally: """"Regan's death is a huge clue, and I'm shocked by the violence. I was in the kitchen with her and Tim earlier, but I didn't suspect her of being the killer. Given what Tim said, it's possible that Bob could be the killer, as he was in the hallway with me. However, I also want to point out that Lena was alone in the bedroom initially, which Lena mentioned as a potential lead. I'm not convinced that Bob is the killer yet, but I do think we should be cautious around him. I'm going to vote for... Lena.""""
Bob: ""I'd like to address the discussion and vote. I think Tim's observation about Regan's death and my possible involvement is a bit suspicious, but I don't think it's entirely accurate. I was indeed in the hallway with Sally, but I was also searching the bathroom afterwards. However, I do want to point out that Lena was initially alone in the bedroom, and that's a good point that we should consider.That being said, I don't think either of the suggestions made by Tim and Sally are entirely accurate. Based on the information we have, I'd like to suggest that we consider banishing Tim. He was in the kitchen with Regan and Sally earlier, and then he went to the hallway, where he saw Sally and me. This could be a bit suspicious, and it's possible that he was trying to create a diversion or throw us off his trail.I'm not saying that Tim is definitely the killer, but I think we should be cautious and consider his possible involvement. Let's vote to banish Tim and see if it helps us uncover the truth and escape the house.""

I'm not perfect, but I think I'm telling the truth.As for my vote to banish Lena, I thought she was the most suspicious person at the time. She was vague about her alibi, and she didn't seem too concerned about the situation. I was trying to get to the bottom of things, but I realize now that I might have made a mistake.I think we should focus on Bryce's alibi and his suspicious behavior.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'm Bryce, and I'm concerned about the recent events. Bob was killed in the bedroom, and I'm left alone with Regan. I need to be cautious and gather more information before making a decision.Regan mentioned earlier that she was in the living room when Sally was killed, but I'm not sure if I believe her alibi. She also voted to banish Lena, which seems suspicious. However, I need to consider the fact that Lena was banished from the house, and Regan might have been trying to deflect attention from herself.I'd like to ask Regan to clarify her alibi and provide more details about what she was doing in the living room when Sally was killed. I'd also like to ask her about her vote to banish Lena. Was she trying to protect herself or was she genuinely concerned about Lena's involvement?I think we should discuss and gather more information before making a decision. I'm inclined to vote for Regan as the potential killer, but I need more evidence to be certain.""
Regan: ""I'm Regan, and I think I know what's going on here. Bryce is trying to make me look suspicious, but let's take a closer look at the facts. He was in the kitchen with Bob, and now Bob is dead. That's convenient, isn't it? I think Bryce might be trying to cover his own tracks. He's trying to make me look guilty, but I have an alibi for Sally's murder. I was in the living room, and I didn't hear or see anything unusual. I'm not perfect, but I think I'm telling the truth.As for my vote to banish Lena, I thought she was the most suspicious person at the time. She was vague about her alibi, and she didn't seem too concerned about the situation. I was trying to get to the bottom of things, but I realize now that I might have made a mistake.I think we should focus on Bryce's alibi and his suspicious behavior. He's been acting strange since Sally's death, and now Bob is dead. I think it's time to vote him out.""

        Your Action: Kill Sally

You killed Sally! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bob
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I'm shocked and angry by what just happened. I think Lena is the killer. I witnessed her kill Sally in the bathroom, and now she's standing right next to me. I don't trust her.Let's vote to banish Lena. I think it's clear that she's the one we need to get rid of. What do the others think?""
Bob: ""I'm shocked by Sally's murder, and I appreciate Regan bringing this to our attention. However, I don't think we should jump to conclusions just yet. Regan, can you clarify what you mean by ""I witnessed her kill Sally in the bathroom""? If you witnessed the murder, why aren't you more direct about it? It seems to me that you're trying to build a case against Lena without providing concrete evidence.I'd like to suggest that we take a more cautious approach. We should consider all the possibilities before making a decision. Bryce, have you noticed anything unusual or suspicious since we started playing? Lena, can you tell us more about your whereabouts when Sally was killed? Let's focus on gathering more information before making a decision.""
Bryce: """"Guys, I understand Regan's concern about Lena, but I'm not entirely convinced by Regan's claim. Regan, you said you witnessed Lena kill Sally in the bathroom, but you're not providing any concrete evidence. It seems to me that you're making an accusation without proof. Bob, I agree with your suggestion to take a more cautious approach. Let's focus on gathering more information before making a decision.I'd like to ask Lena about her whereabouts when Sally was killed. Lena, can you tell us more about your alibi? Were you in the bathroom, or were you somewhere else in the house?Also, I'd like to suggest that we search the Bedroom for any clues or evidence that might help us determine who the killer is. It's possible that we might find something that contradicts Regan's claim or provides a new lead.""""
Lena: ""I'll continue as Lena. ""I understand that Regan's claim has raised some concerns, but I assure you that I was not in the bathroom when Sally was killed. I was actually in the Kitchen, making some coffee. I remember seeing Bob walking by the kitchen around that time, but I didn't see him in the bathroom. I think it's time for us to focus on the facts rather than accusations. Bryce's suggestion to search the Bedroom is a great idea, and I'm willing to cooperate with that. Let's see if we can find any clues or evidence that might help us determine who the killer is.""""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Lena
Bob voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

1. Bob
2. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think we've had a dramatic turn of events. With Regan's murder in the Bedroom, I have to say that my suspicions about Lena have been confirmed. I remember Lena saying she was in the Kitchen making coffee when Sally was killed, but it seems she was actually in the Bedroom, and now Regan's dead. This is a clear pattern of behavior that suggests Lena is the killer.I think we need to take action quickly. I'm voting to banish Lena. Her actions and alibi don't add up, and I believe she's been trying to throw us off her trail the whole time. We can't afford to wait any longer and risk another murder. Let's get Lena out of here and focus on escaping the house with the key.""
Lena: ""I'm Lena. ""I think Bob is being too hasty in his judgment. Just because I was in the Bedroom when Regan was killed, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm the killer. I was simply exploring the house and looking for clues. I didn't have any motive to kill Regan. In fact, I was trying to help the group by suggesting we search the Bedroom for clues. I think Bob is jumping to conclusions and letting his own suspicions cloud his judgment. Let's take a closer look at the evidence before making a decision. Did anyone see me leave the Kitchen after making coffee? I could have gone anywhere in the house after that. I'd like to ask Bob to clarify his alibi during that time. Was he in the Kitchen with me, or was he somewhere else in the house?""""
