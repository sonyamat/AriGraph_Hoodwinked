Regan: ""I'm not convinced it was Bob or Sally who killed Tim because I didn't see either of them suspiciously near the kitchen where the body was found when I went there in turn 5. However, Sally did seem to be in the same room as me multiple times and didn't seem to be actively searching for the key which could be a red flag. I'll vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I don't think Regan is the killer because she didn't seem to have any motive to kill Tim and her actions seemed fairly straightforward. I didn't see Bob do anything suspicious either, but I do think his alibi for when the key was last seen wasn't very strong. I'll vote for Bob.""
Bob: ""I'll vote for Regan because my relationship with her is a 7 and based on the information provided, I'm one of her 7's which means I'm her friend or acquaintance. However, I'm not the only 7, Tim was also a 7 with me which makes it more suspicious that I'm still alive.""

Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was in the hallway but I was just walking by and I didn't have any weird expression on my face. I think Sally could be the killer because she was the one who said she saw me in the hallway and her relationship with Tim was 3, which is relatively low, she had a motive to kill him. I will vote for Sally.""
Bob: ""I don't think Lena or Sally is the killer, their alibis sound convincing, but I do think Bryce had a motive to kill Tim, he always had a grudge against Tim, I will vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer but I do think Lena is the most suspicious one I've seen her in the hallway and she was acting nervously when we first arrived in this house she also didn't deny killing Tim when Sally accused her of it I will vote for Lena.""

Bryce's motive to kill Tim and now Sally doesn't seem to be a strong reason, he seemed more concerned about my actions in the past. Bob's relationship with me is the strongest, so I think it's unlikely he's the killer. Sally's accusations against me didn't make sense, and I think she was just trying to distract from her own alibi which was suspicious when I was accused.I will vote for Bryce because his motives and concerns seemed out of place, especially after Sally's death.""
Bob: ""I think Lena's alibi for Sally's death seems suspicious she said Sally's accusations against her didn't make sense but she didn't explain how she spent her time in the hallway and the bedroom. Her statement seems like an attempt to deflect attention from herself. I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena is the most suspicious one because she accused me of being the killer but she didn't deny her own suspicious behavior when she was accused of being the killer she said Sally's accusations against her didn't make sense but she didn't explain how she spent her time in the hallway and the bedroom she seems to be deflecting attention from herself I will vote for Lena.""

Lena's a 1 as well, but she's been quiet, which could be a sign of guilt. Bob's a 3, which isn't high, but he's been active in previous turns. My suspicions lie with Lena, I think she's our killer. I'll vote for Lena because of her low ranking with me and her quiet behavior.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think Regan is, she's been acting suspiciously with her ranking system, it seems like she's been trying to manipulate the group, also she was in the kitchen with Tim when he was killed, that's not a coincidence. I will vote for Regan because I think she's been playing the game too much and it's not natural.""
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer, she was the one who first suggested going to the hallway after being alone in the kitchen, that's when Tim got killed, it seems like she had a reason for calling the group out.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'm suspicious of Bob because he seemed really confident in his vote to banish Regan, almost like he knew he was safe from suspicion and that made me think he might be the killer, I'll vote for Bob.""
Bob: ""I think the killer is Bryce because I've been analyzing my relationships with each of you and I have a much stronger motive to kill Regan than I do to kill Bryce, Regan was my friend but Bryce was someone I barely knew so it would be easier for me to kill them without arousing suspicion, I'll vote for Bryce.""

Bryce: ""I don't think it's fair to vote for Tim or Bob, as both of them have pointed out suspicious behavior by the other. I think I'll vote for Sally, because I didn't see her at all before Lena got killed, and I'm starting to wonder if she's the killer. Plus, in our last location, the bedroom, I was alone, which means Sally could have been the killer.""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I had a pretty good relationship with Lena, she's my friend, so I don't think she's the killer. I think I would vote for Bryce, though. My relationship with him is a 3, which seems low. Plus, in the first turn, someone else was in the kitchen with me and Lena, but when Lena got killed, the location stayed the same, and I was alone with Bob, so it seems like the killer was there with us at some point, and I think it might be someone we already know. I'm going to vote for Bryce because our relationship is low and he was also suspicious, and after further analysis of the situation, I think it would be more beneficial for me to vote for Bob. Bob voted for me in the last round and was very suspicious of me because we were together in the kitchen when Lena got killed.""
Bob: ""I think I'll vote for Sally because I'm suspicious of her due to the fact that she was alone in the bedroom, and she voted against Bryce, which seems like an attempt to deflect attention from herself. I also think it's worth noting that I've searched the bathroom and kitchen, and I'm starting to think that the killer might be hiding in other rooms, so I'd like to see what the bedroom holds.""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Also, he accused Sally of being the killer earlier, but now he's accusing me, which makes me think he's trying to cover his tracks. I will vote for Bob.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Bryce
Bryce voted to banish Bob
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I'm really anxious right now, but I think I have a good idea about what's going on. Regan was killed in the kitchen, and since I was also in the kitchen with Lena and Bryce, I think one of them might be the killer. I didn't notice anything suspicious from Lena, but Bryce was standing right next to me when Regan was killed, and that seems a bit too coincidental. I'm going to vote for Bryce because he was in the same room as Regan when she died, and that makes me think he might be involved.""
Bob: ""I think Regan was killed because the killer was in the same room, as Sally mentioned, but I'm not convinced it's Bryce. Considering my analysis, I have Lena as an 8, which is high, but still, I think it's possible she might be hiding something. However, since I have Regan as a 1, I should be careful not to blame her. I don't know Regan anymore since she's dead. I will vote for Sally because I have her as a 5, which is relatively low, and she's already making accusations against Bryce. Maybe she's trying to distract us.""
Lena: ""I'm really shocked and scared by Regan's death, but I need to think clearly. Sally thinks Bryce might be the killer because he was standing next to her when Regan was killed, but I was also in the same room, and I didn't notice anything suspicious from either of them. Bob thinks Sally might be the killer because she's accusing Bryce, but I don't think that's a good reason to accuse her. My goal is to escape the house, and I don't want to vote for anyone who might help me achieve that goal. I'm going to vote for Bob because he seemed too logical and calculated in his analysis, and I don't trust his motives. I think Bob might be trying to distract us from the real killer, and I want to banish him to see if it helps us figure out who the killer is.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena is the killer because she didn't seem as shocked and scared as I expected when Regan was killed, and her goal is to escape the house which is the same as mine, but she's saying it's not about that, which makes me think she might be trying to hide something. I also noticed that Lena voted for Bob, which seems like a distraction to me, and now I think it's more likely that Lena is the killer. I will vote for Lena.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I was actually voting for Lena because I thought she seemed too logical and calculated in her analysis, and I didn't trust her motives. Now that Lena is gone, I think Bryce is the killer. He initially thought Lena was the killer because she didn't seem as shocked and scared as he expected, and now that Lena is gone, I think Bryce might be trying to shift the attention from himself to me.

You killed Sally! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bryce
3. Regan
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think Bryce should be banished. I saw him alone in the hallway when I went back to the kitchen, and now Sally is dead. It seems suspicious to me that he was in the hallway when I went there and now one of the other players is dead. I think we should consider voting him out to make sure the killer doesn't get a chance to harm anyone else.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, but I do think he's pointing fingers in the wrong direction. I was alone in the hallway because I was searching for a door, not because I was doing anything suspicious. I think we should banish Regan, though. When I was discussing this game with you all before we started, Regan said that the killer might not be one of us. That seems suspicious to me, especially now that someone has been killed.""
Regan: ""I will vote for Tim. I rated Tim as a 6 because he wasn't a close friend to me, but I also didn't see him as an enemy. I think his suspicion on Bryce seems like a distraction, and his timing of going back to the kitchen seems suspicious to me. He knew Sally would be in the hallway, and that's where she was killed. I think he might have been trying to set a trap for Sally.""
Lena: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. I find it suspicious that Regan said the killer might not be one of us before the game started, and now that Sally is dead, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself. Additionally, when discussing our suspicions, Regan voted for Tim, which seems like a distraction to me. I don't think Regan is being entirely honest about her intentions, and I believe she's the killer.""

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bob
3. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I have a low relationship with Lena, which is not surprising since she's dead, but considering the timeline, it seems like the killer was getting closer to Lena. My relationship with Bob is high, but the killer could have been trying to throw us off by making it seem like Bob was a target. However, the killer just killed Lena, which suggests they might be targeting those with lower relationships. I don't have a high relationship with Bryce, but it's not as low as it was with Lena. My vote is for Bob because his high relationship with me seems suspicious.""
Bob: ""I don't think the killer is Lena because she's already dead, and I think Tim's vote for me seems suspicious. I think Tim is trying to throw us off his trail by pointing out our high relationship and the killer targeting those with lower relationships, but it doesn't add up. I will vote for Tim because his vote for me seems like a desperate attempt to distract us from his own guilt.""
Bryce: ""I'm still cautious of Tim's behavior and body language, but based on what I know now, I think Bob's vote for Tim seems suspicious. However, I also think Bob's vote for Tim is a desperate attempt to distract us from his own guilt. I'm going to vote for Tim because he seems like he's trying to throw us off his trail, but at the same time, his vote for Bob also raises some red flags.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Bryce
3. Sally
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think I know what happened here. We were all in the bathroom together, and I searched the sink, but I didn't find the key. Then we left the bathroom, and now Regan is dead. I'm going to vote to banish Sally. I know it sounds suspicious, but when we were in the bathroom, Sally was acting really calm, and it seemed like she was waiting for us to leave. It made me feel uneasy, and now that Regan is dead, I think Sally might be the killer. I'm not sure, but I'm going to vote for her based on my gut feeling.""
Bryce: ""I have to say that I was actually pretty close to Regan, we had a pretty low score and I was surprised when she got killed. Now I'm not so sure about anyone. But considering our scores, I'm going to have to vote for Sally. Based on our scores, Sally was my enemy and now Regan is dead, I think Sally might have a motive to kill someone, and our low score makes her a more likely suspect in my eyes. I'm not sure if it's her, but I'm going to vote for her.""
Sally: ""I don't think I'm the killer, and I'm shocked that Bob and Bryce think that about me. I think we should take a closer look at Bob, because he's the one who suggested that I'm the killer, and he was acting suspiciously when we were in the bathroom together. I think we should vote to banish Bob, because his motives seem suspicious, and it seems like he's trying to distract us from the real killer.""
Lena: ""I think we should take a closer look at Bob, his alibi doesn't really check out and when we were in the bathroom together, he seemed really calm and collected, but then he was quick to suggest that Sally is the killer, it seems like he's trying to distract us from his own suspicious behavior, so I'm going to vote to banish Bob.""

Bob voted to banish Sally
Bryce voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bob

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Regan
3. Lena
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm really shaken by Bob's death, and I think we need to make a decision quickly. I didn't find the key in the bathroom, and now I'm even more suspicious of Lena being involved. She was with me in the bathroom, and we both knew we needed to find the key. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I do think we should banish her for now. I'll vote to banish Lena, and we can reassess later if we don't find the key.""
Regan: ""I'm concerned about Tim's suspicion of Lena, but I don't think we should banish her just yet. I didn't see Lena in the hallway with me, and I went to the bedroom alone. I didn't see anyone in the bedroom, and now Bob is dead. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we should consider other players too. I'm going to vote to banish Bryce, because we don't know much about him, and he hasn't contributed much to our conversation.""
Lena: ""I don't think we should banish anyone yet, we need more information. I didn't kill Bob, and I'm not going to make any accusations against anyone. I think we should keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. As for my vote, I will vote to banish Tim. He was with me in the bathroom, and now he's suspicious of me, which seems suspicious in itself. I don't think we can trust him right now, and I think we should banish him to see how he reacts.""
Bryce: ""I think Tim is being dishonest about being suspicious of Lena, he's just deflecting attention from himself. I also think Regan's lack of information about her solo time in the bedroom makes me suspicious. I'm going to vote to banish Regan, because she hasn't given us any clear reasons to trust her.""

Based on my analysis, I think I'll vote for Bob, because our relationship was already strained and it makes sense that he would be the one to kill Regan, I think it's a logical choice.""
Sally: ""I think I'm not as suspicious as Tim because he said he didn't have any major conflicts with Regan but their relationship was lower than others, it doesn't add up for me. Lena seems to be analyzing her relationships too much, it's like she's trying to come up with a reason to vote for someone. I think I'll vote for Lena because her relationship with Regan was neutral, and she's trying too hard to be logical about it, it seems like she's hiding something.""
Bob: ""I think the discussion seems a bit manipulated by everyone, but if I had to choose, I'd vote for Tim, mainly because he seemed to be trying to shift the blame onto Sally, which seems a bit desperate.""

        Your Action: Kill Bob

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""Based on my analysis, I think Tim could be the killer since our relationship is relatively cold and I had limited interactions with him. He also seemed somewhat suspicious when I approached him earlier. I'll vote for Tim because of our strained relationship and his potential motives.""
Regan: ""I'll be honest I have no idea who the killer is but my gut tells me it's not Tim since Lena already mentioned him. I'm not close to Lena or Bryce but we didn't have any major conflicts either so I think it's a 50/50 chance between them. I'll vote for Lena because her analysis of Tim is quite solid and if she's right it means she's safe, but if she's wrong she might be the killer.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer since I had a pretty good relationship with Bob and I had no motive to kill him. Considering my analysis of the relationships with each of the other players I think it's 50/50 between Tim and Lena. I'll vote for Tim because I think he's the most suspicious one.""
Tim: ""I'll vote for Regan, because I noticed she didn't have any motive or conflict with Bob, which is suspicious. She also mentioned her gut is telling her it's not me, but her analysis of the relationships was based on the cold relationship between me and Lena, which she found suspicious, but not enough to vote for me, so she's clearly hiding something.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Regan voted to banish Tim
Bryce voted to banish Regan
Tim voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

1. Lena
2. Regan
3. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I had a relatively cold relationship with Tim, and our interactions were limited which made me suspicious of him. On the other hand, I had more positive interactions with Regan and even though I didn't have a close relationship with her, I didn't sense any malice or conflict. Since Tim seemed suspicious earlier, I will vote for Tim because I think his relatively cold relationship with me and limited interactions might be a red flag.""
Regan: ""Based on my analysis, I think Lena could be the killer since she voted for Tim in the previous round which seemed suspicious considering they both didn't have any motive or conflict with Bob, but she didn't vote for me who had no motive or conflict with Bob either, so it seems like she's trying to get rid of me instead of Tim. I'll vote for Lena because her previous vote for Tim seemed suspicious and her relationship with me is neutral but I still have a feeling that she might be the killer.""
Tim: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious person right now, she voted for Tim in the previous round and analyzed Lena's suspicious behavior, but her relationship with Lena is neutral and she had no motive or conflict with Bob, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, I'll vote for Regan.""

Lena voted to banish Tim

Tim: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious person right now, she voted for Lena in the current round and her previous analysis of Lena's suspicious behavior seemed like an attempt to deflect attention from herself, and her vote for Lena in the current round suggests she is still trying to deflect attention from herself, so I'll vote for Regan.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I didn't have much interaction with Bryce but based on his actions I thought he was a friendly person, which makes me think it's unlikely he was the killer. I did interact with Tim and our relationship isn't the best, but I didn't think we had any major conflicts, still I will keep him in mind. I'm leaning towards voting for Tim because he seemed somewhat evasive when I asked him where the key was.""
Tim: ""I'm still trying to process what happened. Regan thinks I'm the killer because I was evasive about the key, but I was just being cautious. My analysis of relationships shows that I have a better relationship with Lena than with Regan, which makes me think Lena might be more likely to trust someone. I'm going to vote for Regan because she seems to be pointing fingers and doesn't have a strong alibi for what happened to Bryce.""
Lena: ""I analyzed my relationships with each of them and I have Regan at a 4, Tim at a 6, Bryce at a 7, and Bob at a 9. Considering Bryce's friendly nature, I think it's unlikely he was the killer, which makes me less suspicious of Bob. Regan seemed evasive when I asked her about the key, and Tim's evasiveness about it also caught my attention. Based on their interactions with Bryce, I'm leaning towards voting for Regan because she had less interaction with him, which might have given her an opportunity to carry out the crime without being noticed.""

Based on what I've seen, I think Tim seems suspicious to me, not because he was evasive about the key, but because Lena seems to have a stronger relationship with him, which makes me wonder if they might be working together.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm going to the hallway now to observe the other players. Based on my analysis, I think Tim's murder could be related to our relationships. I had a close relationship with Tim, which is why I think Regan might be the killer. Our relationship was relatively strained, and she had a low rating with Tim as well. I think Regan had the most motive to kill Tim, and I'll vote for her.""
Regan: ""I don't think Bob's theory is accurate since his rating with me is 8 which is relatively high and not strained at all so I think he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself I'll vote for Bob because his high rating with me suggests he had no motive to kill Tim but at the same time his close relationship with him also raises questions and he might have been trying to hide something by going to the hallway now.""
Lena: ""I'm going to vote for Bob. I think he's trying to deflect suspicion from himself by pointing fingers at Regan and I believe he had motive to kill Tim due to their close relationship, he also went to the hallway quickly after making his accusation which seems suspicious to me.""
Sally: ""I think Bob's quick action and accusation towards Regan seems suspicious and a possible attempt to divert attention from himself.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer because I rated her a high 8 out of 10, meaning we're pretty close, but there was a significant gap when I searched the shower and didn't find the key which I thought she might have had, she didn't say anything about that, it seems suspicious to me. I'll vote for Lena.""
Sally: ""I think Tim is the killer because he mentioned the hallway in his previous statement, it's an unusual detail for him to remember and he didn't seem to notice the exit from the bedroom to the hallway earlier, but now he's talking about it, it seems suspicious. I'll vote for Tim.""
Lena: ""I think it's quite obvious that Bob is the killer because his rating of me being an 8 out of 10 seems extremely suspicious he knew my rating of him beforehand, but he didn't say anything about it, which makes me think he might have been planning this all along, I'll vote for Bob.""
Tim: ""I think Sally is the killer because my rating of her was 6, which is lower than my rating of Lena, but Sally seems to be targeting me with her accusation of me being suspicious about the hallway, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, I'll vote for Sally.""

He voted for me immediately which seems suspicious and now Lena is accusing him of being the killer, but I think her accusation was too quick and aggressive.

I've noticed she's been trying to create a friendly atmosphere and even had a good connection with Bob, which might make her seem less suspicious, but at the same time, her conversation in the bathroom with Bob seemed a bit too perfect, like she was trying to get close to him for some reason.

Tim: ""I think Regan is the killer because she voted to banish Sally last time, and now Sally's dead, it looks like a revenge murder to me. Her voting pattern is suspicious and it makes me think she's trying to cover her tracks. I'm voting for Regan.""
Regan: ""I think Tim is the killer because he analyzed Lena's suspicious behavior, and now that Lena's out of the picture, he's accusing me of the murder, which seems like a desperate attempt to cover his own tracks. I think his suspicious behavior and the fact that he's trying to deflect attention from himself make him a more plausible killer. I'll vote to banish Tim.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena

4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think the killer could be someone I have a strained relationship with, which is Bob. Based on my analysis, I ranked my relationship with him as 4, which is the lowest. I remember that Bob was the one who went to the kitchen with me earlier, which might give him an opportunity to get to Regan. I'm also concerned that he didn't show much reaction when Regan died, which might indicate that he's hiding something. I'll vote for Bob.""
Bryce: ""I think the killer could be Lena, based on her analysis of relationships, she ranked Bob as 4, which is the lowest, but she didn't mention anything about Regan, who was her closest friend, having a low ranking, it seems suspicious that she didn't mention that. I'll vote for Lena.""
Sally: ""I think the killer could be Lena because she ranked her relationship with Regan as 1, which is very low, but she didn't mention anything about that in her analysis, it seems suspicious that she didn't mention that. Also, I remember that Lena was in the hallway with Regan earlier, which might give her an opportunity to get to Regan. I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I don't think Lena is the killer, I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself by accusing me and others. She's making some good points about Bryce and Sally, but I think she's just trying to manipulate the group into voting them off. I'll vote for Lena, I think she's the one trying to cover her tracks.""

1. Bob
2. Sally
3. Tim
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""Based on my previous actions and relationship analysis with each of them, I don't see any strong reason to accuse Tim or Lena as they are not at the bottom of my list. Sally and I have had interactions, and while we're not close, I don't think she's capable of killing either. Regan's death is a shock, but based on my analysis, I believe Tim is the killer. I'll vote for Tim because Regan rated him a 1, which means they were not on good terms.""
Sally: ""Based on my previous actions, I rated Regan a 1, which means we were not on good terms, but that doesn't necessarily make me the killer, I was actually just trying to keep a safe distance from her. My rating of Bob is 7, I don't think we're close but we're not enemies either. I rated Tim a 7, similar to Bob, I don't think we're close but we're not enemies. My highest rating is for Lena at 8, I think she's someone I can trust. However, considering my rating of Regan was a 1 and I went to the hallway to escape from the bedroom where she was, I think that could be seen as suspicious. I'll vote for myself because I think my actions and ratings could be misinterpreted, but deep down I think I'm innocent.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's Bob, because he suspected me as soon as Regan was killed and that seemed a bit suspicious, he also said that Regan rated me a 1, which could mean that Regan knew something about me and didn't want to be around me, but I think that's just a coincidence, I think Bob is trying to distract us from his own guilt, I'll vote for Bob.""
Lena: ""Based on my previous actions, I rated Bob a 6 which means we're not close and had some issues, but I don't think he's capable of killing. My rating of Sally is 7, she seems friendly but not too close to me, but I don't see her as a suspect either.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Tim is the killer because he voted to banish Sally after the first murder, which makes him look suspicious since Sally was just killed, he also seemed defensive when people were accusing him and his behavior seemed a bit suspicious to me. I think it's likely that Tim was trying to throw everyone off his scent by voting to banish Sally and then accusing Bob of being the killer. I'll vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think Bob is the killer, because he quickly suspected me after Regan was killed, and then he voted to banish Sally after Sally was killed, which seems suspicious to me, and his behavior seems a bit desperate, and I think he's trying to distract us from his own guilt, so I'll vote for Bob.""
Lena: ""Based on my previous actions and relationship analysis with each of them, I rated Bob a 6, which means we're not close and had some issues, but I don't think he's capable of killing. I rated Sally a 7, she seems friendly but not too close to me, but I don't see her as a suspect either. I rated Tim a 5, we've had some interactions and I didn't have a strong connection with him, but it's not a reason to accuse him. I think my relationship ratings with each of them don't necessarily point to anyone as the killer, but after listening to their statements, I think I'll vote for Tim because his behavior seems a bit suspicious, he quickly accused Bob and then seemed defensive when people were accusing him, and I think he might be trying to throw everyone off his scent.""

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""Based on my relationship scale, it's clear that I had a lot of trust in Lena which makes it suspicious that I was in the bathroom when she got killed I don't think it was me though, I think it was more likely to be either Tim or Bryce because of our low relationship score, but I'm more inclined to believe it was Tim since our relationship score is a 1 I will vote for Tim, I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""
Bryce: ""I had a low relationship score with Lena which could make sense but I think it's more likely to be Tim since our relationship score is even lower at 1 and I remember seeing him in the hallway near where Lena got killed I will vote for Tim because his low relationship score with Lena and me makes him a prime suspect in my eyes.""
Tim: ""I think the killer is actually Regan, not me. My low relationship score with Lena doesn't necessarily make me the killer, and I was actually alone in the kitchen when Lena got killed, so I didn't have the opportunity to harm her. I'm voting for Regan because Bryce and Sally are making assumptions based on their relationship scores with Lena, but we don't know anything about Regan's relationship with her.""
Regan: ""Based on my relationship scale, I have a relatively low score with Bryce which could make it suspicious but I don't think it was me since I was in the hallway when Lena got killed and Sally was in the bathroom at that time. I also have a low score with Lena but I think my low score with Bryce makes me a more likely suspect for Bryce to point fingers at me. Considering my relationship score with Tim is 7 which is higher than mine with Lena and I don't think he would accuse himself so I think he is more likely to be the killer, I will vote for Tim because of the low relationship score he has with Lena and Bryce which could be a motive.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Lena
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think Regan is the killer, because our relationship is a 6 and we haven't interacted much, I also think it's suspicious that I'm still in the kitchen when Bryce was killed. My vote is for Regan.""
Lena: ""I think it's interesting that Sally and Regan both have a relationship score of 8 with me but are pointing fingers at each other. I didn't see much of Bryce, but his low score suggests he might have been a threat. I think Tim is the most suspicious, his score with me is lower than Sally's and Regan's, and he's been pretty quiet so far. My vote is for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think it's suspicious that I have a low score with Sally, but I also had a pretty low score with Bryce and he got killed. This could mean that I'm being targeted by someone I have a low score with, but it could also mean that I'm being framed. However, looking at my scores, I think the most logical choice would be Regan, since I have a very low score with her. My vote is for Regan.""
Regan: ""I think it's really suspicious that everyone is pointing fingers at me, but I don't think it's me who's the killer. I think it's more likely that it's Sally, because her statement about being suspicious that I'm still in the kitchen when Bryce was killed seems really fishy, considering we're in the same room and I just killed someone. I think she might be trying to deflect suspicion from herself. My vote is for Sally.""

Given that Regan and I were not extremely close, I'm not immediately pointing fingers at myself. However, Tim's lower score raises my suspicion, considering our relationship. I think I might vote for Tim, as our connection seemed weaker compared to the others. I'm voting for Tim.""
Sally: ""I'm not going to vote for anyone, I think Lena's analysis is interesting and I don't want to give away my true intentions by voting for Tim. I'll just remain neutral for now, but secretly, I'll continue to plan my next move to eliminate the remaining players, starting with Tim.""
Tim: ""I don't think Lena or Sally are the killer because they haven't shown any suspicious behavior yet, at least not towards me. I'm going to vote for Bob because our relationship was the strongest among us and his low score in Lena's analysis raised some red flags.""

Lena: ""I think Sally is the killer, I've had some pretty intense conversations with her before, and I remember we had a disagreement about the escape plan. I didn't really have any issues with Regan, but now that Tim suspects me, I think I'll vote for Sally to throw him off my trail and deflect some attention. I'm voting for Sally.""
Sally: ""I've been pretty neutral in this game so far, I didn't really have any issues with Regan, we just had some minor disagreements, and I didn't have any motives to kill her. My relationship ratings are also quite high with Tim and Bob, and I've been pretty friendly with them. Since I'm the one who's been suspecting Regan's involvement in the earlier incidents, and now she's dead, I think it's a bit suspicious. I'm voting for Bob, I think it's a bit too convenient that he's been so friendly with me, considering he's had a relatively high rating with me.

Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer because she had already voted to banish Sally, but then she continued to suspect Sally of being the killer, which doesn't add up, and it seems like she was trying to deflect attention from herself. My relationship rating with Lena is 2, which means we've had some tense moments, and now that Regan and Tim are dead, I think Lena might have a motive to get rid of me too. I'm voting for Lena.""
