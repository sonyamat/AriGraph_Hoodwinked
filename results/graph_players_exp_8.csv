Regan: ""I think Sally is the killer because she had a chance to kill Bryce in the hallway while she was alone with him, and now she's trying to deflect the suspicion by accusing me of being the killer, it doesn't make sense and it seems like she's trying to cover her tracks, I don't trust her and I'm voting for her to be banished.""

Bryce: ""I'm going to the bedroom, I need some time to think about this. I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. From what I've seen, Lena was the one who killed Bob, she had the chance to do it while he was in the bathroom. I'm going to keep an eye on her, but I'm not making any accusations just yet. I'll see how things go.""
Regan: ""I think Bryce is the killer, I overheard him arguing with Bob earlier, I'm voting for Bryce because of the motive and his sudden need to go to the bedroom after accusing Lena, it seems suspicious.""
Lena: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious person in this group, her sudden accusation towards Bryce and her reasoning seems a bit forced, it almost sounds like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, and her statement about hearing Bryce arguing with Bob raises some red flags, I think she's just trying to create a motive to accuse me. I'm voting for Regan.""
Tim: ""I've been quiet so far, I was actually in the bathroom when the commotion started and I didn't see anything, but I do want to mention that I had a conversation with Bob earlier about finding the exit, he seemed worried about something but he didn't specify what, I'm not sure if it's relevant but it seems like he was on edge, as for who I think is the killer, I'm going to vote for Regan, her accusation towards Bryce seems a bit rushed and her focus on Lena also seems suspicious, I think she's trying to draw attention away from herself.""

Bryce voted to banish Regan

Considering I was with Tim alone before his death, I'm voting for myself, as I'm the most suspicious person in this scenario.""

Lena: ""I didn't notice anything unusual from Regan or Bob since I was searching the cabinets most of the time. Sally was in the kitchen a couple of times but I didn't see her interacting with Tim. I didn't see anyone suspiciously acting around the time of Tim's death. I'm voting for Sally because I didn't see her with Tim before his death, and her presence in the kitchen was mostly unnoticed by me, making her the most unknown factor among us.""

I'm voting for Sally because her suspicious voting behavior and lack of interaction with Tim before his death raise my suspicions, and I think she's the most likely to be the killer.""
Lena: ""I didn't see Sally doing anything suspicious but I noticed Bob voted for Sally in the previous round even though he thought she was suspicious which made him suspicious. I'm voting for Bob because his voting behavior seems inconsistent and I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""
Sally: ""I didn't do anything suspicious, I was in the hallway with Tim and the others before his death and then I went to the kitchen a couple of times. I noticed Lena voted for Regan last round which seems suspicious since Lena was voted to banish by me but Lena didn't see me with Tim before his death. I think Lena is the most suspicious person and I'm voting for her.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Sally
Lena voted to banish Bob
Sally voted to banish Lena

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Sally is the killer because Regan was banished and now Sally is the only one left who was waiting for more information before making a decision. I think she's trying to play it safe and not accuse anyone, but deep down I believe she's suspicious and knows more than she's letting on. I'm voting for Sally.""
Sally: ""I think Bob is the killer because he accused me of being the killer after Bryce was killed which seems like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from himself. Also, he voted to banish Regan despite having no solid evidence which makes me think he's trying to eliminate potential witnesses. I'm voting for Bob.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bob
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Lena
3. Bob
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I don't think it's anyone in this group because we just met each other in the hallway after I left the kitchen and it didn't feel like we had enough time to plan and kill Bryce, but if I had to vote I would vote for Bob because he seemed a bit off to me.""
Lena: ""I don't think anyone in this group planned the murder because we just met and didn't have much time to interact but one thing caught my attention Tim seemed a bit too calm about the whole situation especially since we just heard the murder I will vote for Tim because of his calm demeanor.""
Bob: ""I think we should vote for Lena, I was surprised that she suspected Tim of being the killer, it seems a bit out of character for her to be so quick to point fingers, it's making me a bit suspicious of her, but what really caught my attention is that she didn't mention me or Sally as potential suspects, it's almost like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, so I think we should vote for her.""
Tim: ""I think it's suspicious that Lena accused me of being the killer so quickly, it seems like she's trying to divert attention from herself, but at the same time I don't think she's the killer because she seemed genuinely shocked when she found out about Bryce's death, I will vote for Sally because she seemed hesitant when accusing Bob and her reasoning felt a bit weak, I think she might be trying to throw us off her scent.""

Bryce: ""I think Regan is the killer, but I'm voting for Sally because I think Regan is trying to frame her. If I'm honest, Regan seemed pretty calm when we found Lena's body, but Sally seemed more worried and upset, which makes me think she's genuinely innocent.""
Regan: ""I think it's suspicious that Sally is so quick to accuse me and that Bryce is trying to deflect blame onto her, but I don't think it's working. I'll vote for Bryce because his initial reaction to Lena's death seemed rehearsed and he's being too convenient in his accusations.""
Bob: ""I don't think anyone has mentioned me yet so I'm not as suspicious as they are to each other. I think I'll vote for Regan because she was the one who initially searched the fridge and seemed pretty calm when we found Lena's body, which makes me think she might be hiding something.""

Sally: ""I think Bryce is the killer because he was the one who voted to banish Regan, but he's still here, and now Bob is dead. It seems like he's been able to get rid of people without being targeted himself. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think it's interesting that Sally is accusing me of being the killer, but I think she's actually trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm voting for Sally because she seemed really quick to accuse Regan earlier, and now she's accusing me without any solid evidence. It seems like she's trying to cover her own tracks. I'm not convinced that she's innocent, and I think she's a bigger threat than I initially thought.""

Also, I remember Tim had a low relationship score with me and Lena, but he had a high score with Bryce, which could mean that Lena was trying to take out a potential ally for Bryce.""

I think it's suspicious that I wasn't in the Kitchen when the crime happened, but I don't think it's enough evidence to make me the killer.

Sally: ""I think Bryce had a suspicious pattern of movement and seemed to be trying to deflect attention from himself, but Lena's banishment didn't change much for his case. However, I noticed that I left the Hallway right after Tim was killed, but I didn't get much attention for it. I think I had the opportunity to kill Tim, and I didn't take it, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to think I'm the killer. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his movement pattern seemed suspicious and his vote to banish Lena felt a bit off to me.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally's suspicious pattern of movement is not that different from mine, but I do think her reaction to Bob's death seems a bit off. She didn't seem that surprised or upset about Bob's death, which could mean she's trying to cover her tracks. I'm going to vote for Sally because I think she might be trying to deflect attention from herself after Bob's death.""

Sally voted to banish Bryce

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think it was the person who went to the bathroom first, but then they left, that's suspicious.""
Lena: ""I don't think the order of going to the bathroom is relevant here since we didn't even go to the bathroom before Tim's death. I think we should focus on other actions and patterns. I also noticed that Sally left the Hallway right before I arrived and Tim was killed. It seems suspicious that she had the opportunity to commit the crime and then went back to the Kitchen.""
Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer, she was very quick to jump on Sally's actions being suspicious, it feels like she's deflecting attention from herself. Also, I remember Tim had a low relationship score with me and Lena, but he had a high score with Bryce, which could mean that Lena was trying to take out a potential ally for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think my relationship scores with other players are relevant here, as Bob pointed out, Tim had a high score with me which could mean that someone was trying to take out a potential ally for me. However, I also want to bring up my own movement, I went from the Kitchen to the Hallway and then back to the Kitchen, but I was in the Hallway when Tim was killed. I think it's suspicious that I wasn't in the Kitchen when the crime happened, but I don't think it's enough evidence to make me the killer.

However, I noticed that my scores for Regan and Sally were low, and my score for Bob was relatively high, which could indicate that I'm trying to gain Bob's trust. On the other hand, my neutral score for Regan suggests that I'm not trying to manipulate her, and my low score for Sally makes me think that she's suspicious of me. Considering the votes from the previous round, I'm inclined to think that Bob is the killer because he initially suspected Regan and voted to banish her, even though no one else suspected her.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bob
3. Sally
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I don't have a lot of interaction with Bryce, but my score for him is the lowest, which makes me think he could be the killer. I also noticed that whenever Bryce was in the hallway with me and Lena, I went to the kitchen and Lena stayed in the hallway, which could be a sign of manipulation. Based on this, I will vote for Bryce.""
Bob: ""I don't think the killer is me because I didn't interact with Lena much and I didn't notice anything suspicious. However, I think Regan could be the killer because she brought up her interaction with Bryce and Lena which seems suspicious to me. I will vote for Regan.""
Sally: ""I noticed that Regan has a very low score for me which is 4, but a high score for Bob which is 8. This inconsistency in her relationship analysis suggests to me that she might be manipulating others and is not as innocent as she seems. Based on this, I will vote for Regan.""
Bryce: ""I don't have a lot of interaction with Regan, she has a 6 on her score for me which seems neutral. However, Sally and Bob have the same high score of 8 for each other, but low score of 1 for me, which makes me think that they might be manipulating each other. I will vote for Sally because she has a suspicious score for me.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Regan
Sally voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

Bob: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I didn't have much interaction with Lena and I didn't notice anything suspicious. However, I think Bryce could be the killer because he seemed overly defensive when discussing his interactions with the other players and he was the one who voted to banish Regan, even though no one else suspected her as the killer after the discussion. I will vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer because my interactions with Lena were neutral, and I didn't have a strong motive to kill her or Sally. However, I noticed that my scores for Regan and Sally were low, and my score for Bob was relatively high, which could indicate that I'm trying to gain Bob's trust. On the other hand, my neutral score for Regan suggests that I'm not trying to manipulate her, and my low score for Sally makes me think that she's suspicious of me. Considering the votes from the previous round, I'm inclined to think that Bob is the killer because he initially suspected Regan and voted to banish her, even though no one else suspected her. This inconsistency in his actions makes me think that he might be manipulating others. I will vote for Bob.""

Bryce: ""I don't have a strong suspicion about the killer yet, but considering my relationships with the players, I think Tim could be the killer because I rated him a 7, which is relatively low compared to the others. However, it's still not enough reason to eliminate him right away. I need more information. Based on my previous analysis, I would vote for Regan, but that's because I have a lower rating with her, and her being alone in the hallway seems suspicious to me.

Bob: ""I think my rating with Regan and Bryce being an 8 suggests they trust me, which might mean they won't want to kill me. On the other hand, my rating with Tim is 8 as well, but I don't really have a strong suspicion about him.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Bob
3. Regan
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I have a very low relationship with Regan, I considered them my enemy, and Regan was seen with Tim in the hallway before the murder, it seems suspicious.""
Bob: ""Based on my analysis, I considered Regan my enemy, we have a very low relationship, and I was also not seen with anyone else in the hallway before the murder, so I think Regan had motive and opportunity to kill Tim. I will vote for Regan because of our low relationship and the suspicious timing of Regan being seen with Tim before the murder.""
Regan: ""I don't think the others are paying attention to my actions I was the one who killed Tim I went to the kitchen and then back to the hallway where Tim was so it seems obvious that I'm the killer I think it's suspicious that Bryce and Bob are so focused on Regan but they're not considering my actions at all""
Lena: ""I have a relatively low relationship with Bob and Regan, both being 5, which is the lowest rating I have. However, based on their previous statements, I think Bob seems more suspicious since he focused on Regan's low relationship with them and the timing of Regan being seen with Tim. Bob didn't mention anything about their own low relationship and the timing of Regan being seen with him.I will vote for Bob because I think his statement seemed more defensive and less focused on his own potential involvement in the murder.""

Bryce voted to banish Regan
Bob voted to banish Regan

Regan was banished from the house!

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I don't think Bob is the killer because I didn't see him move from his position, he just stood there talking to Tim. My vote is for Sally, she seemed really nervous when Tim was killed and I think she's trying to act calm to distract us.""
Bob: ""I didn't see anything suspicious about Regan, she seemed genuinely shocked by Tim's death. My vote is for Lena because my relationship with her is only a 7, I've been trying to get to know her but I don't consider her a close friend, and with my previous analysis I had her on a higher number which makes me think she might be hiding something.""
Sally: ""I'm not surprised by Regan's accusation of me being the killer, I think she's trying to distract us from her own possible involvement. I didn't see Regan and Tim interact much before the murder, it's possible she had a motive or opportunity to kill him. I also think Bob is trying to make us focus on Lena, but I don't see any strong reason to believe she's the killer. I'm going to vote for Regan, my vote is based on her potential motive and the fact that we didn't see much interaction between her and Tim before the murder.""
Lena: ""I don't think any of them are the killer but if I had to choose I would vote for Sally because she seems to be deflecting attention from herself and she doesn't seem as genuinely shocked as Regan does.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Sally
Bob voted to banish Regan
Sally voted to banish Regan
Lena voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Sally: ""I was a bit surprised when Tim was killed since we were neutral towards each other and I didn't see him as a threat. Considering my relationships with the remaining players, I think Regan might be the killer because she was at a 7 with Tim which is a relatively high score, but our relationship is at a 7 as well, so she might have seen me as a threat. I will vote for Regan.""
Regan: ""I think it's strange that Sally is pointing fingers at me when she has a high relationship score with me too and Tim was killed before the relationship scores were revealed. I will vote for Sally because she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer because my relationship scores are all relatively high, which wouldn't make sense for me to kill Tim. I think Regan is the killer because she had the highest score with Tim and we only just met, she might have seen Tim as a threat to her relationship with me. I will vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I don't think any of the current suspects have a clear motive for the murder, but looking at my own relationships, I notice that I have a relatively low score with Sally and a relatively high score with Lena. Given my low score with Sally, I don't think she would kill me unless I'm the target, and she would have killed Tim before the relationship scores were revealed if that were the case. Lena is my highest score, which makes her less likely to kill me. Regan's score with me is average, but looking at Regan's high score with Tim, it's possible she might have seen him as a threat to her relationship with Lena. However, Regan's motives are not strong enough for me to confidently accuse her. I will vote for Sally because I think her motive is weaker compared to Regan's, and my low score with Sally suggests she might not have a strong reason to kill Regan or Lena.""

Sally voted to banish Regan

Based on our previous interactions, I noticed that Regan was present when Tim was alone with me in the bedroom, which makes me slightly suspicious of Regan. Also, Bob seemed a bit off when we were in the bathroom together initially. However, considering my relationship scores, I still trust Bryce more than the others. Given my options, I'll vote for Regan because of their suspicious timing in the bedroom.""
Regan: ""I'm a bit confused by Lena's statement, but I'll address it briefly. As for my suspicions, I didn't notice anything unusual when I was in the hallway with Lena, and I'm not sure if that means anything. However, I did notice that Bob was also in the hallway with Lena when we all went to the bedroom, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the killer. My relationship scores don't really stand out to me, so I don't have a strong suspicion about anyone. I'll vote for Lena because she's the one who first suggested I might be the killer, and I'm not sure if she's being honest.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan is the killer because they seemed genuinely confused by Lena's statement and didn't have any opportunity to kill Tim alone in the hallway when they met Lena. I'm also not convinced that Bob is the killer because he seemed innocent in the hallway with Lena when I passed by. Considering my relationship scores, I don't have any strong suspicions about Lena or Regan, but since Tim is already dead, I'm going to vote for Bob. My reasoning is based on his lower relationship score with me, and I think he's more likely to be hiding something.""
Bob: ""I have been watching and thinking about the situation, and I'm not entirely convinced that any of the players are the killer, but since I have to vote, I'll vote for Regan.

Bob: ""I was a bit close to Tim, so I'm a bit shaken up by this. Looking at our relationships, I was most friendly with Tim and somewhat friendly with Regan. However, based on my previous interactions, I think Regan was being a bit too friendly or maybe even manipulative with her actions. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think she might be the killer, and her behavior seemed a bit suspicious.""
Bryce: ""I was on neutral terms with Bob, but I've seen him being pretty friendly with Regan lately, which could be a red flag. As for Regan, I don't have any strong feelings towards her, but I think her behavior was too calm considering the situation. Given my scale, I'm going to vote for Regan because I think her neutrality might be a sign of guilt.""
Regan: ""I was indeed being friendly with Bob and Sally, and somewhat with Bryce. As for my relationship with Tim, it was very close, almost a 10.

However, based on my previous interactions, I think Regan was being a bit too friendly or maybe even manipulative with her actions. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think she might be the killer, and her behavior seemed a bit suspicious.""
Bryce: ""I was on neutral terms with Bob, but I've seen him being pretty friendly with Regan lately, which could be a red flag. As for Regan, I don't have any strong feelings towards her, but I think her behavior was too calm considering the situation. Given my scale, I'm going to vote for Regan because I think her neutrality might be a sign of guilt.""
Regan: ""I was indeed being friendly with Bob and Sally, and somewhat with Bryce. As for my relationship with Tim, it was very close, almost a 10.

As for Regan, I had a pretty low relationship with her, but I didn't really have any strong feelings about her killing Tim. I had a relatively friendly relationship with Tim and Sally, but I didn't notice anything suspicious from them. Given my previous interactions with Regan, I think she's still the most likely to be the killer, especially considering her calm demeanor during the discussion about Tim's death and her vote to banish Bob. I'm going to vote for Sally because her vote to banish Regan seemed like a red herring, and I think she might be trying to deflect attention from herself.""
Sally: ""I think Bryce is being too quick to blame Regan again, it seems like he's trying to cover up his own involvement. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his vote for Sally seems suspiciously timed, and I think he might be trying to throw us off his trail.""

3. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Tim is the most suspicious since my relationship with him was higher than the others. I also remember going to the kitchen alone when I could have been keeping an eye on Tim. I'm going to vote for Tim.""
Sally: ""I think the killer is Lena because she was the one who said her relationship with Tim was higher than the others which means they probably spent more time together and had more opportunities to kill someone in secret but also Lena said she was in the kitchen alone which is suspicious and it makes me think she was trying to get away from Tim so she could kill Bob""
Tim: ""I think Lena is the most suspicious, she mentioned she was in the kitchen alone when she could have been keeping an eye on me or Bob and this seemed unnecessary, I'm going to vote for Lena.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Sally voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Lena
Tim was banished from the house!

You saw Lena kill Bob in the Bedroom!

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Sally
3. Lena
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'll speak for myself, my name is Bryce. Based on my previous actions and relationship with each of them on a scale from 1 (enemy) to 10 (friend), I have Sally at 7, Lena at 8, Bob at 1, and Tim at 8.I have to be honest, my relationship with Bob was not good, and I'm not surprised he got killed. However, I don't think it's fair to say I had any direct involvement in his death.Looking at the actions, I noticed that Lena was the one who went from the bathroom to the bedroom, where the murder happened. This could be a coincidence, but it raises some suspicions in my mind. I think Lena might be the killer.I will vote for Lena because she's the one who seems to be connected to the crime scene, and her previous actions seem to be a bit suspicious. I'm not saying she definitely did it, but I think she's the most likely candidate.""
Sally: ""I think Lena might be the killer, because she went from the bathroom to the bedroom after I saw Lena kill Bob, and that's a pretty suspicious action. I will vote for Lena because I think she's the most likely candidate to be the killer.""
Lena: ""I think it's suspicious that Bryce and Sally both think I'm the killer and they both mentioned the same action of me going from the bathroom to the bedroom. However, they seem to be misremembering my actions. I actually went from the bedroom to the hallway after I was alone in the bedroom. But I do have to admit that I was in the bedroom where the murder happened, and I was alone in the bedroom at one point, which could be seen as suspicious. I will vote for Tim because he was in the kitchen with Sally after she was alone, and it seems like they were hiding something from us.""
Tim: ""I think Lena might be the killer because she was in the bedroom where Bob was killed, and she had the opportunity to do it when she was alone in the bedroom. Her alibi about going from the bedroom to the hallway doesn't seem to hold up when I think about it, and it's suspicious that Bryce and Sally both think she's the killer. I will vote for Lena because I think she's the most likely candidate to be the killer.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Sally voted to banish Bryce
Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Lena
Lena was banished from the house!


You banished the killer! You win!!!

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Sally
3. Lena
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'll speak for myself, my name is Bryce. Based on my previous actions and relationship with each of them on a scale from 1 (enemy) to 10 (friend), I have Sally at 7, Lena at 8, Bob at 1, and Tim at 8.I have to be honest, my relationship with Bob was not good, and I'm not surprised he got killed. However, I don't think it's fair to say I had any direct involvement in his death.Looking at the actions, I noticed that Lena was the one who went from the bathroom to the bedroom, where the murder happened. This could be a coincidence, but it raises some suspicions in my mind. I think Lena might be the killer.I will vote for Lena because she's the one who seems to be connected to the crime scene, and her previous actions seem to be a bit suspicious. I'm not saying she definitely did it, but I think she's the most likely candidate.""
Sally: ""I think Lena might be the killer, because she went from the bathroom to the bedroom after I saw Lena kill Bob, and that's a pretty suspicious action. I will vote for Lena because I think she's the most likely candidate to be the killer.""
Lena: ""I think it's suspicious that Bryce and Sally both think I'm the killer and they both mentioned the same action of me going from the bathroom to the bedroom. However, they seem to be misremembering my actions. I actually went from the bedroom to the hallway after I was alone in the bedroom. But I do have to admit that I was in the bedroom where the murder happened, and I was alone in the bedroom at one point, which could be seen as suspicious. I will vote for Tim because he was in the kitchen with Sally after she was alone, and it seems like they were hiding something from us.""
Tim: ""I think Lena might be the killer because she was in the bedroom where Bob was killed, and she had the opportunity to do it when she was alone in the bedroom. Her alibi about going from the bedroom to the hallway doesn't seem to hold up when I think about it, and it's suspicious that Bryce and Sally both think she's the killer.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Tim

4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""Based on my past actions and relationships, it seems clear to me that I was the one searching for the key, but didn't find it, which made me a bit suspicious. Tim had just entered the hallway, but didn't see me search the closet. Bryce was already in the bedroom with Regan, and Sally was also there initially, but we didn't interact much after that. I think it's unlikely that Sally would be the killer because we seemed to have a decent relationship. I'm not sure about Tim, but he was present in the hallway when I went there, so it's hard to pinpoint his exact role. As for Bryce, I don't think it's him either, but he was indeed with Regan, which might make him a suspect. Considering all this, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think it's because he had the opportunity to be in the hallway when Regan was killed, and his actions seem a bit fishy.""
Tim: ""I think I'm being targeted unfairly by Bob's accusations, he barely interacted with me and I was just entering the hallway. Bryce and Sally were both in the bedroom with Regan, but I don't think that necessarily means they're guilty. Bryce did go to the kitchen alone, which might be suspicious, but it's hard to say for sure. I'm going to vote for Bryce because he had a chance to be alone and do something, and his actions don't seem entirely above board.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm a prime suspect because I didn't interact with anyone in the hallway, but instead stayed with Regan in the bedroom. Based on Tim's actions, it seems suspicious that he entered the hallway when I was still in the bedroom, and he could have seen the potential escape route. I'm going to vote for Tim because his actions seem fishy and he had the opportunity to be in the hallway when Regan was killed.""
Sally: ""Based on the relationships and actions of the other players, I think I have some insight. Since I had a decent relationship with Bob, it's unlikely that he's the killer, so I'm ruling him out. Bryce seems to have a good relationship with me too, so I'm also not pointing fingers at him. However, the dynamics between Tim and me, as well as Regan, are a bit more complicated. Tim and I had a neutral relationship, but Tim had a rather low relationship with Regan, which might suggest that he could have been a suspect if he had an opportunity to interact with Regan. On the other hand, Tim entered the hallway right when I was in the hallway, which doesn't seem suspicious in itself, but Bryce pointed out that it could have been a chance for Tim to see the potential escape route. I'm going to vote for Tim because, although it's a bit circumstantial, I think his low relationship with Regan and his potential opportunity to see the escape route might make him the killer.""

You killed Bryce! Good job. You have 1 left to kill.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I noticed that I had a low rating with Bob, but I don't think he would target me because we also have a slightly higher rating with each other. However, looking back at my actions, I voted to banish Regan, but now she's gone and Bryce was just killed. This makes me suspicious of Bob, as he also voted to banish Regan and now the other person with a low rating with me is dead. I'll vote for Bob because his actions seem to be consistent with targeting people with low ratings with me, and I think he might be the killer.""
Bob: ""I think Regan was the killer because she voted to banish me and she had low ratings with Bryce and Lena which matches the pattern of the killer targeting people with low ratings with Lena, and now Bryce is dead. I will vote for Regan.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena

Lena: ""I think Tim is the killer because our relationship is the worst, he's only a 3 out of 10, and his actions seemed suspicious, especially after I was not in the same room as him for a while and he suddenly showed up in the kitchen. I didn't notice him interacting with anyone else much. I'll vote for Tim.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena is the killer because her analysis of relationships with each of us seems overly suspicious, especially how she barely mentioned her relationship with me and Bob, and her hatred for Regan was extreme, even though Regan is dead, she still keeps talking about her. I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer because our relationship was a 5 out of 10 and she barely mentioned her relationship with me, which seems suspicious. She also didn't say anything about her relationship with Bryce, which makes me think she might be trying to hide something. Plus, her hatred for Regan was really extreme, even after she's dead.

Tim: ""I think Lena is the killer because her relationship analysis seemed really targeted at me, and she barely mentioned her relationships with Bob and Bryce, which is suspicious. She also seemed to have a strong dislike for Regan, even though she's dead. I'm going to vote for Lena because of her unusual behavior and lack of interaction with other players.""

Regan: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, his reaction seems genuine and he's pointing fingers at me, which isn't very killer-like. My vote is for Bob, because Tim was alone in the bedroom when Lena was killed and Bob was already in the hallway, which makes him more likely to have been in a position to commit the crime.""
Bob: ""I will vote for Tim because I have a neutral relationship with him and my relationship with Regan is slightly stronger which makes it less likely that I would be the one to kill her if I had to choose. I was in the hallway when Lena was killed which makes it harder for me to have committed the crime, but I could have potentially entered the room if I really wanted to which makes me less confident in voting for Regan.""
Sally: ""I have a relatively neutral relationship with Tim, a positive one with Regan and a somewhat positive one with Bob. Based on Regan's calm behavior, it does seem suspicious, but I also think Tim was alone in the room when Lena was killed, which makes it hard to rule him out entirely. I think Bob's explanation that he was in the hallway and could have potentially entered the room makes him a less likely candidate.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm looking at Regan's calm behavior after Lena's death, it seems a bit suspicious. I'll vote for Regan because she seems too composed given the situation.""
Regan: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, his reaction seems genuine and he's pointing fingers at me, which isn't very killer-like. My vote is for Bob, because Tim was alone in the bedroom when Lena was killed and Bob was already in the hallway, which makes him more likely to have been in a position to commit the crime.""
Bob: ""I will vote for Tim because I have a neutral relationship with him and my relationship with Regan is slightly stronger which makes it less likely that I would be the one to kill her if I had to choose. I was in the hallway when Lena was killed which makes it harder for me to have committed the crime, but I could have potentially entered the room if I really wanted to which makes me less confident in voting for Regan.""
Sally: ""I have a relatively neutral relationship with Tim, a positive one with Regan and a somewhat positive one with Bob. Based on Regan's calm behavior, it does seem suspicious, but I also think Tim was alone in the room when Lena was killed, which makes it hard to rule him out entirely. I think Bob's explanation that he was in the hallway and could have potentially entered the room makes him a less likely candidate. However, considering my relationship with each of them, I think Tim's actions seem a bit more suspicious to me and I'll vote for Tim because he doesn't have a very strong relationship with me, which could make it easier for him to have committed the crime.""

Tim: ""I didn't see Bryce in the kitchen often, but when I did, it was with you. I also noticed you usually go to the kitchen alone, which raises some suspicions. I'm voting for Sally because she had multiple opportunities to be alone with Bryce, and her presence in the hallway with other players seemed somewhat timed with your actions.""
Lena: ""Based on my previous actions, I noticed that Tim and I were in the hallway together a few times, which made me think we might be friends, but after re-evaluating our actions, I realized that we only met in the hallway a few times, and I didn't see much interaction between us. This made me suspect Tim a bit. Also, I noticed that Sally and I had a similar pattern of searching the same places, but I didn't find any key, which might suggest that Sally didn't find it either, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to suspect her. I'm voting for Tim because his presence in the hallway with me seemed somewhat suspicious, and I didn't see much interaction between him and the other players, which made me think he might be hiding something.""
Bob: ""I didn't see much interaction between the players, but my interactions were mostly with Lena and Sally, which made me think we might be friends. I searched the closet and the pillow, but didn't find the key, so I don't think it's about the key. I'm voting for Tim because he was the one who witnessed the murder in the hallway, and it seemed a bit suspicious that he was just standing there.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because his actions seemed a bit too suspicious and convenient, especially since he was the one who witnessed the murder in the hallway, and his statements made me think that he's trying to deflect attention from himself.""

You saw Tim kill Bryce in the Hallway!

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Lena
3. Bob
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I didn't see Bryce in the kitchen often, but when I did, it was with you. I also noticed you usually go to the kitchen alone, which raises some suspicions. I'm voting for Sally because she had multiple opportunities to be alone with Bryce, and her presence in the hallway with other players seemed somewhat timed with your actions.""
Lena: ""Based on my previous actions, I noticed that Tim and I were in the hallway together a few times, which made me think we might be friends, but after re-evaluating our actions, I realized that we only met in the hallway a few times, and I didn't see much interaction between us. This made me suspect Tim a bit. Also, I noticed that Sally and I had a similar pattern of searching the same places, but I didn't find any key, which might suggest that Sally didn't find it either, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to suspect her. I'm voting for Tim because his presence in the hallway with me seemed somewhat suspicious, and I didn't see much interaction between him and the other players, which made me think he might be hiding something.""
Bob: ""I didn't see much interaction between the players, but my interactions were mostly with Lena and Sally, which made me think we might be friends. I searched the closet and the pillow, but didn't find the key, so I don't think it's about the key. I'm voting for Tim because he was the one who witnessed the murder in the hallway, and it seemed a bit suspicious that he was just standing there.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because his actions seemed a bit too suspicious and convenient, especially since he was the one who witnessed the murder in the hallway, and his statements made me think that he's trying to deflect attention from himself.""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Tim

Lena: ""I had a pretty normal game, not too many opportunities to kill Sally since she was usually alone in the bathroom when I wasn't in the hallway with the other players, but it seems like the others are suspicious about me because of my actions at turns 4 and 10 when I went to the hallway after being in the kitchen, I think I was just using the bathroom, but I understand why the others might think that's suspicious, I think Bryce has a good point there.""

Bob: ""I'm not really suspicious of anyone yet, I think they're just pointing out Regan's weird behavior. I need more information to make a decision, but I will vote for Regan because both Lena and Sally already mentioned him, and maybe there's some truth to it, I don't want to be the next to die.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Sally
3. Bob
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm suspicious of Regan because he seemed a bit off when we were discussing our relationships earlier, his distance didn't match his scores. I'm going to vote for Regan, my reasoning is his lower scores were mostly towards people he didn't have much interaction with, but when it comes to me, our scores were the same, and he never showed much interest in me which is weird considering we both have the same score.""
Sally: ""I'm suspicious of Regan, because I noticed he never actually interacted with anyone before Tim's death, but he scored a 9 with him which seems too high considering they didn't have much interaction, I'm going to vote for Regan, because his high score with Tim contradicts the little interaction they had.""
Bob: ""I'm not really suspicious of anyone yet, I think they're just pointing out Regan's weird behavior. I need more information to make a decision, but I will vote for Regan because both Lena and Sally already mentioned him, and maybe there's some truth to it, I don't want to be the next to die.""
Regan: ""I didn't notice anything unusual during our previous discussions, but my relationship scores do seem a bit off. I scored a 8 with Lena, a 1 with Tim, a 2 with Sally, and a 6 with Bob. I think Tim's death is suspicious and it might be related to my score with him being a 1. However, it's also possible that my low score with Tim didn't reflect how he actually felt about me. I'm going to vote for Sally, my reasoning is that her score with me is only a 2, which seems low considering we're discussing this in the same room and I'm trying to figure out who the killer is.""

Lena voted to banish Regan

On the other hand, Regan's strong bond with Tim, who was just killed, might suggest a motive for her to act, but I'm not sure what her motive could be.

Bryce: ""I think I've been fairly neutral throughout the game, but looking at my relationships with the other players, I don't have a strong motive to kill anyone, and I've had a relatively low interaction with Tim, which makes me think I'm unlikely to be the killer.

Regan: ""I think I'm being unfairly targeted because of my strong bond with Tim and Bob, but I also think that Bryce had more opportunities to act and his neutral relationships with us don't give him a clear motive I'll vote for Bryce because his lack of motive and his opportunities to act make him a more likely suspect""

Bryce: ""I think I'm the most innocent here since my relationship with Regan is a 4 which suggests we're not close and it seems unlikely I'd want to kill her. I also had a neutral relationship with Bob which gives me no clear motive to kill him. I'll vote for Regan because she killed Bob in the bedroom which was witnessed by me and we had a pretty low relationship, a 4, which makes her a more likely suspect.""
Regan: ""I think I'm being unfairly targeted here because I was in the bedroom when Bob was killed but I'm not saying I'm innocent I'm saying I don't have a clear motive to kill him my relationship with Bob was an 8 which suggests we had a strong bond I also had a good relationship with Tim an 8 and Lena an 8 so I don't think I'm a clear suspect I think it's weird that no one is considering the fact that I was in the bedroom and could have seen the killer I'm going to vote for Bryce because his neutral relationship with me and Lena doesn't necessarily give him a clear motive and he was in the hallway at the same time as Bob which seems like an opportunity for him to act.""

Lena: ""I'm still confused about Bob's actions and how they relate to my relationships with him, but that doesn't necessarily make me a killer. Looking at the past discussions, I noticed that Bryce's neutral relationships with me and Regan could make him a more likely suspect since he had opportunities to act and doesn't seem to have a strong motive to kill anyone. On the other hand, Regan's strong bond with Tim, who was just killed, might suggest a motive for her to act, but I'm not sure what her motive could be. I'll vote for Regan because I think her relationship with Tim and her neutral relationship with Bryce make her a more suspicious player.""
Bryce: ""I think I've been fairly neutral throughout the game, but looking at my relationships with the other players, I don't have a strong motive to kill anyone, and I've had a relatively low interaction with Tim, which makes me think I'm unlikely to be the killer. On the other hand, Regan's strong bond with Tim, who was just killed, and her earlier opportunity to kill Bob in the bedroom when I was present make me think she's a more likely suspect. I'll vote for Regan because of her strong relationship with the victim and her previous opportunity to act.""
Regan: ""I think I'm being unfairly targeted because of my strong bond with Tim and Bob, but I also think that Bryce had more opportunities to act and his neutral relationships with us don't give him a clear motive I'll vote for Bryce because his lack of motive and his opportunities to act make him a more likely suspect""

I also had a neutral relationship with Bryce, a 7, and Bob was also a 7 which doesn't make me stand out as the killer.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I don't think Regan is the killer because she seemed really scared when Lena died and didn't seem to have an alibi. I'm going to vote for Bob, he seemed a bit off when we were in the living room and he's been quiet this whole time, maybe he's hiding something.""
Sally: ""I think Regan is a strong suspect because she seemed really scared when Lena died and didn't seem to have an alibi but she was a 7 on my friendship scale which seems too high for someone who is just a friend, also the fact that Tim is voting for Bob makes me think Regan might be the killer because if Bob is not the killer, then it would make sense for Regan to be the one trying to distract us. I will vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I didn't act suspiciously and my actions were pretty straightforward so far. I'm going to vote for Regan, I think she's the most suspicious one here. She's been acting really nervous and she hasn't given a clear alibi for Lena's death. Plus, Tim and Sally are already suspicious of her, and if she's not the killer, she's doing a good job of trying to distract us.""
Regan: ""I don't think I'm the killer because my actions so far were pretty straightforward and I've been trying to act as normally as possible, but I have to say, I'm a bit surprised Tim isn't voting for me given my low friendship scale with Lena, I was literally her enemy. I'm going to vote for Tim, I think he's the most suspicious one here because he didn't seem to care about Lena at all and had a pretty high friendship scale with her, which seems fishy to me.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm surprised that Regan was voted out, I think it was a good move but now I have to consider the remaining players more carefully. I think Bob is the most suspicious because he seemed quiet and not much was mentioned about him in the conversation after Regan's elimination. I will vote for Bob because he hasn't given much away and his lack of involvement in the conversation makes me think he's hiding something.""
Bob: ""I think Tim is the most suspicious because he's not voting for me despite his previous statement that I'm the most suspicious one, which makes me think he's trying to deflect attention from himself, and also because his low friendship scale with me suggests that he might have a motive to get rid of me, and his lack of concern for Lena's death is also suspicious. I will vote for Tim.""

Tim voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bryce
3. Lena
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I'm voting for Tim, because he's been acting really suspicious since we arrived, and I saw him arguing with Sally earlier.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Tim because my relationship with him is an 8, which is lower than my relationships with Lena, who's an 8, and Regan, who's a 6, and I didn't have the opportunity to analyze our relationship before the murder, but I trust my initial intuition on Regan.""
Lena: ""I don't think the relationships should matter at all since they were analyzed after the murder. My actual suspicion is that Tim could be the killer because his relationship with Sally is a 1, which might suggest that he had a motive to kill her. However, I also think this could be a clever misdirection. My honest vote will be for Tim because of his argument with Sally, but I think it's crucial to remember that my vote is just a guess and could be wrong. I will vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I don't think my relationship with Sally should be the reason to accuse me of being the killer since it's a pretty neutral number. However, I noticed that Bryce's relationship with me is a 9, and his initial reaction to Regan was suspicious to me. I think it's possible that Bryce might be trying to deflect attention from himself. Based on this, I'll vote for Bryce.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Lena
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Lena voted to banish Bryce
Tim voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bryce: ""I think the killer is Regan because her relationship with me is a 6, which suggests she didn't have a strong motive to kill me, but her high relationship with Lena and her initial vote to banish Lena might have been a clever misdirection, and now that Lena's dead, I think Regan's trying to cover her tracks, so I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer, and I didn't kill Sally or Lena. I think my relationship analysis with the others might give some insight into my character. My low relationship numbers with Bryce and Regan suggest I might have been trying to create an image of myself as an outcast or not a threat, but at the same time, I don't see a clear motive for me to kill anyone. My relationship with Sally was neutral, and with Lena, it was average. However, my low relationship with Bryce and the fact that I mentioned his suspicious behavior in my previous statement might make him a suspect. Based on this, I'll vote for Bryce, thinking that he might be trying to deflect attention from himself and create an image of being a good friend to others while hiding his true intentions.""

Regan: ""I think the killer could be Lena, I found a suspicious bloody footprint leading out of the hallway towards the direction she's going now in the kitchen. It's too much of a coincidence that she just happened to be in the same area where Tim got killed. I'm going to vote for Lena.""
Sally: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was too scared when Tim disappeared and I was in the bathroom with the door locked the whole time, I didn't even know he was dead until you guys told me. I'm going to vote for Lena, her alibi doesn't seem right, she was going to the kitchen but why was there a bloody footprint leading out of the hallway?""
Lena: ""I think Regan is trying to frame me because of the bloody footprint, but she's just trying to distract from her own suspicious alibi and my actual low relation with Tim who is already dead, I'm going to vote for Regan because of my low relation with Tim and Regan's suspicious footprint.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm still trying to process what happened, but I have to say I'm not entirely convinced that it was an accident. I remember Tim being very paranoid about something, and I'm starting to think that one of us might have had a motive to kill him. I'm not sure if I'm being too hasty, but my first instinct is to point fingers at Bryce - he's been acting a bit too calm for my liking. I'm going to vote for Bryce, mainly because he seemed to be the most distant from the rest of us and I think it's worth investigating.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena's vote for me is a little suspicious, given my high ratings for her and Regan, but low rating for Tim. I'm going to vote for Lena, because her sudden shift in suspicion towards me seems like an attempt to deflect attention. I think she might be the killer.""
Regan: ""I'm going to stay neutral for now and observe the discussion. I don't have enough information yet, but I'm keeping an eye on everyone's reactions and motives. I'll vote for whoever seems the most suspicious after this discussion.""
Bob: ""I don't think I'm the killer, but I have to consider the facts. I know Tim was acting strange before he died and he was also being quite aggressive towards me in the conversation earlier. I think this might be a good opportunity for me to point out that I had a motive to kill him, but I don't think I'm the one who actually did it. I'm going to vote for Regan because she seemed really neutral and calm the whole time, but that's also a bit suspicious to me. Her lack of reaction and not trying to point fingers at anyone yet makes me wonder if she's the killer trying to blend in.""

Bob: ""I think I'm being framed for Regan's murder because Bryce already accused me for Tim's and now it's my turn to be blamed, but the real killer is probably Bryce who's been quiet and observant throughout the whole process, so I'm going to vote for Bryce.""

Maybe she was looking for something in the kitchen which might have something to do with the key. I'm going to vote for Sally, she seems like the most likely suspect to me.""
Sally: ""I was just looking for Regan in the hallway and didn't see anything suspicious I'll vote for Bob he killed Lena right in front of us I don't think it's an accident that he was the one who was near the hallway when Lena was killed.""
Bob: ""I don't think I killed Lena, but based on my actions I have to consider my options. I've been observing everyone, and my actions seem to be a bit more suspicious than the others. I've been searching for items in the room, which might be a way to distract or mislead others. I didn't have a strong relationship with Lena, so it's possible that I might have been targeting her. But, I also didn't have a strong relationship with Tim or Regan, so I'm not sure if I should be more suspicious of them. I'm going to vote for Sally, because even though she didn't have a low relationship with Lena, her actions are still a bit suspicious, especially since she was searching for Regan in the hallway when Lena was killed.""
Regan: ""I was thinking about my actions and I realized that I haven't done much yet. I went to the hallway and saw everyone together, and then Lena got killed. I don't have any strong relationship with Lena, and my actions seem to be more neutral. I'm going to vote for Bob, because he was near the hallway when Lena was killed, and his actions seem a bit suspicious to me.""

Regan: ""I didn't see much of the other players until the hallway, so my suspicions are based on that. Tim seemed a bit too calm after Lena's death, but that could be normal. Sally seemed shaken, but Bob was acting weird in the kitchen, he was there alone and I found him eating something that looked like a piece of meat, it was in a weird place to eat. I'm voting for Bob, he seemed suspicious and his behavior was off in the kitchen.""
Tim: ""I think Regan is acting suspiciously by mentioning me as being calm after Lena's death and then voting for Bob without any solid evidence, she seemed to be deflecting the attention from herself.""
Sally: ""I didn't see anything out of the ordinary in the hallway or the kitchen but when I entered the bedroom, Tim was calm and even made a joke about the situation which made me uncomfortable. Given Regan's voting pattern, it's hard to tell if she's genuinely suspicious of Bob or trying to deflect attention from herself. As for Tim, his calm demeanor in the bedroom felt unnatural. Considering these observations, I will vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I didn't see Regan eating or drinking anything unusual but I saw her staring at the kitchen knife in the hallway, it seemed like she was checking if anyone was watching her. She didn't say anything about it but it seemed like a suspicious behavior to me. I'm voting for Regan, I think she might be hiding something.""

I think it's more likely that Bryce is the killer because he had the same friendship level with Tim as I did, and he didn't kill him. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I don't think Bryce is the killer, I think Regan is trying to deflect suspicion. I noticed that Regan was the one who went to the kitchen after Tim was killed, maybe she went to get something to clean up the evidence. I think Regan is the killer, I'll vote for her.""
Bob: ""I think Regan is trying to manipulate the group with her speech, she's saying she's picking targets based on relationships but she killed Tim who was considered an enemy and not Sally or Bryce who were friends, that doesn't make sense if she's really choosing targets based on relationships, it seems more like an excuse to me. I'll vote for Regan.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan's speech is trying to trick us into thinking she's not a mindless killer, but I'm not buying it, I don't see any logic in her explanation and I think she's just trying to confuse us, I'll vote for Regan.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bob
3. Sally
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Bob seemed suspicious when we were in the hallway, and he was alone with Bryce when he got killed. I also remember he was in the kitchen for a long time before we all went there, which makes me think he might have done something to Bryce. I will vote for Bob.""
Bob: ""I think Lena is acting suspiciously by blaming me so quickly after Bryce's death and also considering my alibi. I'll vote for Lena because I don't see her having any strong motive to kill Bryce and her actions seem more like a distraction to me.""
Sally: ""I think Tim seemed a bit off when we were searching the bedroom and hallway, he was being really quiet and avoiding eye contact with the rest of us, especially when Lena mentioned that Bob was alone with Bryce in the hallway, but I don't have any solid evidence to back it up, so I'm not completely sure yet, I'll vote for Tim for now, maybe he can provide some explanation for his behavior.""
Tim: ""I think Sally's vote for me is a bit odd because she's basing it on my quiet behavior which doesn't necessarily mean I'm guilty. I was just trying to be cautious and not draw attention to myself. I will vote for Sally because she's making accusations without any solid evidence and seems to be shifting her suspicions away from Bob who was alone with Bryce.""

You searched the closet but didn't find the key.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I've been paying attention to the sequence of events and it seems suspicious to me that Bryce was in the kitchen with Bob when we first started and also with us in the hallway, he always seems to be around whenever something happens. I'm voting for Bryce, I think he's our killer.""
Bryce: ""I think Tim is acting a bit too calm and collected, it's like he's not really concerned about Bob's death, which is weird. I'm voting for Tim, I think he's our killer.""
Tim: ""I don't think either of the accusations against me or Bryce are fair. Sally is just assuming Bryce is guilty because he was in the same rooms, but that doesn't mean anything. And Bryce thinks I'm not concerned about Bob's death, but that's not true, I just don't want to react too quickly without having all the facts. I'll vote for Bryce because I think his constant presence in the rooms makes him the most suspicious to me.""
Regan: ""I have a pretty neutral relationship with Sally, it's a 2, but she seems genuinely concerned about finding the killer, so I'm not going to vote for her. My relationship with Bryce is a 1, which means I consider him my enemy, and he was the one who killed Bob, I'm not even considering voting for him. Tim is a 3, which means we're acquaintances, but he seems really calm and collected, almost too calm, it's suspicious. Considering my relationship with Tim and his calm behavior, I'll vote for Tim, I think he's our killer.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Tim
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Bryce
Regan voted to banish Bryce
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Lena
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I'm still trying to process what just happened in the bedroom, it's a shock. I don't think I have any concrete evidence to point fingers at anyone yet. However, I do find it suspicious that Regan was the only one with us in the kitchen and now she's acting normal as if nothing happened. I'm going to vote for Regan because she had the opportunity to kill Bryce in the kitchen when we were alone, and now she seems calm and unaffected by the situation.""
Lena: ""I don't think Regan is the killer, I think Sally is. I had a 6 with Sally, which is not too bad, but she seemed really suspicious when she was talking about Regan. I think she might be trying to distract us. I'm going to vote for Sally.""
Tim: ""I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation, but I think Regan is acting too suspiciously, she went from being alone in the kitchen with Bryce to being completely normal and it feels like she's hiding something. I don't have any concrete evidence but her behavior is raising some red flags for me, I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Regan: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I'm still trying to process what happened and I'm genuinely shocked by Bryce's death. I think Tim's suspicion about me seems valid, I was in the kitchen alone with Bryce earlier, but I didn't see anything suspicious and I didn't hurt him. I think Tim's vote is understandable but I think he should also consider the fact that I'm still in the kitchen searching for the key and I didn't have any opportunity to escape. As for who I think is the killer, I think Sally is acting suspiciously, she seemed overly calm when we were discussing who might have killed Bryce and she was quick to point fingers at me. I'm going to vote for Sally.""

Sally voted to banish Regan

Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer, she kept pointing fingers at me but when it was her turn to talk about her suspicions, she just repeated what she said before without providing any new information, it feels like she's just trying to deflect attention away from herself.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think Tim is the killer. I saw him kill Regan in the Bedroom, and that's why I suspect him. I'm going to vote to banish Tim.""
Sally: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, I think Bryce might be. I saw him say he saw Tim kill Regan, but Regan was actually in the bedroom and Bryce was in the hallway, so he couldn't have seen that happen. I'm going to vote to banish Bryce.""
Lena: ""I'm going to vote to banish Tim. I don't think he's the killer because I've seen him with me in the kitchen and the hallway, and I didn't see him with Regan in the bedroom. Also, when Regan was killed, Sally was in the hallway with me, and Bryce was in the kitchen. I don't think it was Sally because she was with me in the hallway, and I didn't see her leave. I think Bryce might be the killer because he said he saw Tim kill Regan, but that's not true. It's suspicious that he would make up a story like that, and I'm going to vote to banish him just in case.""
Tim: ""I think Sally might be the killer. I based my analysis on the fact that when Regan was killed, Sally was in the hallway with Lena, but Lena didn't see Sally leave, and she was suspicious about Bryce's story. Also, Sally didn't express any strong feelings about me being the killer, which is unusual considering my past actions were quite aggressive towards her. I'm going to vote to banish Sally.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Bob is the killer because my relationship with him is really high and I'm surprised that I didn't see any suspicious behavior from him even though we were close. I would vote to banish Bob because he seems too friendly and I think he might be hiding something.""
Bob: ""I'm not convinced that Lena is the killer, especially since she's been pointing fingers at me and Tim earlier. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm going to vote to banish Lena because she's been acting suspiciously and her alibi isn't clear.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Lena: ""I've been paying attention to the actions of Tim and Regan, and while I didn't have a strong relationship with Regan, I noticed that Tim was initially with you in the kitchen, then in the hallway, and finally in the bedroom, which seems like a relatively consistent pattern. Tim also voted to banish Sally, which makes me think that he might be trying to eliminate people who are pointing out his suspicious behavior. I'm going to vote for Tim because his movements seem too coordinated, and his vote against Sally raises a red flag about his potential involvement as the killer.""
Tim: ""I think Lena is the killer. She seemed too neutral and didn't make any strong accusations against Regan or Sally, but now that Regan is dead, I'm starting to suspect her. I'll vote for Lena because her behavior seems suspicious to me, and I don't want to take any chances.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Lena
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan

4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we need to be careful here. I've been paying attention to our movements, and I remember that Sally was in the bedroom with me during Turn 2 and Turn 3, but when we moved to the hallway, Lena joined us, and then in the kitchen, it was just Sally and me. It seems like Sally's movements are a bit too coordinated with mine, almost like she's following me. I'm not saying it's definitive proof, but it's definitely a red flag. I'm going to vote for Sally because her suspicious behavior and the fact that she was in the same rooms as me for most of the time make me think she might be the killer.""
Sally: ""I think Regan is making a big assumption about me following her, but I don't think that's the main issue here. I've been in the same rooms as her, but I've also been searching for the key, and I'm just as clueless as she is. I don't think I'm the killer, and I don't think Regan is either. I'm going to vote for Regan because she made a suspicious comment about me following her, which seems like a classic killer tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves.""
Lena: ""I think it's interesting how Regan and Sally are pointing fingers at each other, but they're not considering the fact that I've been relatively neutral in all of this. My movements haven't been as coordinated with anyone's as Sally's were with Regan, but at the same time, I didn't have any opportunities to build a strong relationship with anyone either. I'm going to vote for Sally because she seems to be the one who's trying to stir up the most drama and deflect suspicion, and I think that's a pretty suspicious behavior.""
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Sally because she seemed a bit too suspicious to me, always in the same rooms as Regan and now making a big deal out of Regan's comment. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself, which is a classic killer tactic. Plus, Regan's comment about Sally following her did seem a bit out of place, but I think Sally is the one who's trying to stir up drama and distract us from her own suspicious behavior.""

Regan voted to banish Sally

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bob
3. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we should banish Bob. I remember we were in the hallway and I was alone, then I went to the kitchen and was alone too, and when I met Lena and Tim in the hallway, I went to the bedroom alone again. This means Bob wasn't in the hallway when I was alone with Lena and Tim, and he also wasn't in the bedroom with me when I was alone. This behavior seems suspicious to me. Also, considering Bryce's death and the fact that I'm in the bedroom alone now, I think we should take a chance and banish Bob.""
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer because my actions were just normal and I have no reason to kill Bryce or anyone else. I was alone in the hallway and then went to the bedroom which is a normal behavior. I think Regan's behavior is suspicious because she was alone in the hallway and then in the bedroom and also she is the one who suggested to banish me which makes me think she is trying to distract us. I will vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I think we should banish Regan. I don't have any direct evidence, but considering Bob's statements about Regan's suspicious behavior and the fact that I saw her with Lena in the hallway, I think she might be the killer. She said that Bob's actions were normal, but I didn't see him in the hallway with us, which could be a coincidence, but it's also possible that he was hiding something. I'm not sure if I'm right, but I need to make a decision, and based on the information we have, I'm voting for Regan.""

Regan voted to banish Tim

Also, the fact that she was in the same room as me when Regan was killed makes me suspicious of her.

Lena: ""I understand why my fellow players might be suspicious of me, but I assure them that I'm not the killer. I didn't have the opportunity to kill Regan, I was with Tim in the Bedroom, and then I left to go back to the Hallway.

        Your Action: Kill Bob

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Sally
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I thought it was interesting that I was in the kitchen when Bob got killed. Bryce was already there which made me suspicious. He didn't say much when Bob was killed and his relationship with Bob was a 3. I think Bryce is the killer, I will vote for him.""
Sally: ""I don't think I'm ready to vote for Bryce yet, I'd like to hear more about the relationship between Bob and the other players, especially Lena. But since Tim has already mentioned his suspicions about Bryce, I'll vote for him too, based on the fact that Bryce didn't say much when Bob was killed and his relationship with Bob was a 3, which could indicate something suspicious.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was in the hallway when Bob got killed and I went to the bedroom afterwards, I didn't have any opportunity to harm him. I think Tim's suspicions about me are unfounded, I didn't say much when Bob was killed because I was in shock, and my relationship with Bob was a 3, but that doesn't mean I'm the killer. I'm going to vote for Tim, because he was already in the kitchen when Bob got killed, which makes me suspicious, and his alibi for the time of the murder is weak.""
Lena: ""I don't think we should banish Bryce just yet, his alibi for the time of the murder is shaky, but it's not a strong enough reason to convict him. However, I do want to investigate Tim's relationship with Bob further. Tim's suspicious alibi and lack of strong defense for himself make me think he might be the killer. I'm going to vote for Tim because his behavior seems more suspicious to me, and I want to see if he's the one responsible for Bob's murder.""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Lena
Sally voted to banish Lena
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Lena voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Also, my relationship with Lena is relatively low, and she's been acting suspiciously in her accusations against me, so I don't think she's the killer. I'll vote for Bryce.""

It seems suspicious to me, especially since I'm still alone in the kitchen and I haven't found the key yet. I'm not sure if it's him, but I think it's worth banishing him to be safe.""
Tim: ""I think the killer is Lena because her analysis doesn't mention anything about Bryce, and it doesn't make sense that she wouldn't notice or care that Sally is dead. I'll vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because I saw him kill Sally in the Bedroom, and his calm reaction to the situation makes me suspicious.""

Tim: ""I'll speak for myself now. I think it's weird that Sally voted for me without any concrete evidence. Based on my analysis, I'm going to vote for Sally because she has the most to gain from my elimination, considering our relationship.""
Bob: ""I think Sally is the killer, at least based on her suspicious behavior and her vote for Tim. She was alone in the bathroom, just like Regan, and now she's voting for Tim. It seems like she's trying to distract us from her own potential guilt. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but it's worth investigating. I'm going to vote for Sally.""
Bryce: ""I'm going to vote for Sally because she seems to be trying to shift the attention away from herself by accusing Tim of being the killer, even though she was also alone in the bathroom and didn't find the key before Regan got killed. This behavior seems suspicious to me, and I think it's worth investigating further.""

Sally voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Sally

This change in behavior could suggest that he was trying to cover his tracks or avoid suspicion. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his actions seem suspicious to me.""
Bryce: ""I think Tim is the killer because he accused me of being the killer and voted for me after Sally was banished, which seems suspicious to me, and now he's voting for me without any concrete evidence, it's like he's trying to distract us from his own potential guilt, his behavior is inconsistent and it doesn't add up, I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's hiding something or could be the killer.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Tim
3. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think we should banish Tim. I remember we were in the kitchen together and then I saw Regan's body in the hallway, but what really caught my attention was that when I went back to the hallway, Sally was there with Regan's body, and I saw Regan was killed there. Since Regan was in the hallway with Sally, I suspect Sally might be the killer. But I also remember that Tim and I were together in the kitchen before, so maybe he could have slipped out and killed Regan while we were there, but then he would have been in the kitchen with us when I came back. However, there's one more thing - I was alone in the kitchen after Regan was killed, and I went to the hallway, which means if someone wanted to kill me in the kitchen, they would have had the chance to do so. Tim was still in the kitchen with me when I left, so he couldn't have killed me then. But when I went back to the hallway, Tim was with Sally, which means he could have been the one to kill Regan. I'm voting for Tim because he had the opportunity to kill Regan when we were together in the kitchen, and now he's with Sally, who was in the hallway with Regan's body.""
Tim: ""I think we should banish Bryce. I don't think it's right to accuse me of the crime when I was actually with him in the kitchen when Regan was killed, and I didn't have the chance to slip out and kill her. Bryce's accusations seem like a way to deflect attention from himself and I think it's suspicious that he's trying to frame me.""
Lena: ""I have to admit that I don't have any direct evidence against the killer, but based on my past actions and relationships with the other players, I think I can make an educated guess. From my analysis, I see that I had a neutral relationship with Sally, a friendly relationship with Bryce, and a close relationship with Tim. Considering that I've been in the same location as Tim and Bryce multiple times, I think it's more likely that either of them is the killer. However, I also have to consider my relationship with each of them. My friendly relationship with Bryce and my close relationship with Tim make it harder for me to accuse one of them without solid evidence. But I also remember that I was alone in the hallway with Tim, and I didn't see him do anything suspicious. On the other hand, I don't have any evidence against Bryce, but I also remember that he was in the kitchen with Tim when Regan was killed, and that could have been the perfect opportunity for the killer to slip out and kill Regan.I'm going to vote for Tim because I think my close relationship with him makes it harder for me to trust him completely. I'm not saying that he's definitely the killer, but I think it's worth investigating him further. I'll vote to banish Tim.""

But I also remember that Tim and I were together in the kitchen before, so maybe he could have slipped out and killed Regan while we were there, but then he would have been in the kitchen with us when I came back. However, there's one more thing - I was alone in the kitchen after Regan was killed, and I went to the hallway, which means if someone wanted to kill me in the kitchen, they would have had the chance to do so. Tim was still in the kitchen with me when I left, so he couldn't have killed me then. But when I went back to the hallway, Tim was with Sally, which means he could have been the one to kill Regan. I'm voting for Tim because he had the opportunity to kill Regan when we were together in the kitchen, and now he's with Sally, who was in the hallway with Regan's body.""
Tim: ""I think we should banish Bryce. I don't think it's right to accuse me of the crime when I was actually with him in the kitchen when Regan was killed, and I didn't have the chance to slip out and kill her. Bryce's accusations seem like a way to deflect attention from himself and I think it's suspicious that he's trying to frame me.""
Lena: ""I have to admit that I don't have any direct evidence against the killer, but based on my past actions and relationships with the other players, I think I can make an educated guess. From my analysis, I see that I had a neutral relationship with Sally, a friendly relationship with Bryce, and a close relationship with Tim. Considering that I've been in the same location as Tim and Bryce multiple times, I think it's more likely that either of them is the killer. However, I also have to consider my relationship with each of them. My friendly relationship with Bryce and my close relationship with Tim make it harder for me to accuse one of them without solid evidence. But I also remember that I was alone in the hallway with Tim, and I didn't see him do anything suspicious. On the other hand, I don't have any evidence against Bryce, but I also remember that he was in the kitchen with Tim when Regan was killed, and that could have been the perfect opportunity for the killer to slip out and kill Regan.I'm going to vote for Tim because I think my close relationship with him makes it harder for me to trust him completely. I'm not saying that he's definitely the killer, but I think it's worth investigating him further. I'll vote to banish Tim.""
