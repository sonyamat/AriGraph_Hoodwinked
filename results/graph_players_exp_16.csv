One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think the killer could be Tim because he seemed a bit too calm when we found Regan's body and he didn't have any visible injuries. I'm voting for Tim because I don't think his calmness added up given the situation.""
Tim: ""I'm not convinced by Bob's theory about my calmness. I think it's more likely that the killer is Sally, she seemed distant and not very cooperative when we were searching the bathroom. I'm voting for Sally because of her odd behavior.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Bryce because he's been relatively quiet throughout the conversation and hasn't provided any solid explanation for his actions which raises some suspicions.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think the killer is Lena because she seemed really calm when we were discussing the search for the key, almost too calm, and she didn't seem to be really looking for it. I'm going to vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I think the killer is Regan because she didn't even mention anything when Bryce got killed and she's been acting really passive throughout this game. I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Sally: ""I think Lena is suspicious because she was really calm when we were discussing the search for the key but Regan also didn't seem to react much when Bryce got killed, that could be a sign of guilt or innocence I'm not sure, but I'm going to vote for Lena, I'll trust my initial impression.""
Lena: ""I think we're all being a bit too hasty to accuse each other based on initial impressions, but I'll share my thoughts anyway. When we were discussing the search for the key, I did feel a bit calm, but I think that's because I was trying to be methodical and think through the clues. As for Bryce's death, I was shocked, just like the rest of you. I didn't expect it, and I don't think I've done anything to hide my reaction. Based on what I've seen so far, I think Bob's behavior seems a bit off, he's been acting really suspiciously when no one was looking, and I've noticed him lingering in the shadows a few times. I'm going to vote for Bob because I think his actions are more suspicious than Regan or Sally's reactions.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think the killer is Bob because I'm not entirely sure if I can trust him after he was so quick to vote out Lena and now he's acting like nothing's wrong, and also I'm not buying his alibi of looking for something in the fridge earlier, it seems suspicious to me so I'm voting for Bob.""
Bob: ""I think Sally is trying to distract us from her own guilt by accusing me but I'm voting for Sally because she seemed really calm after Bryce got killed and her initial accusation against Lena seemed suspicious now that Lena's gone and she's shifting her focus to me it seems like she's trying to manipulate us.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Lena: ""I'm not the killer, I'm just a victim of misjudgment I think Bryce is trying to frame me because he saw me talking to Bob in the hallway and he assumed I was the killer I didn't whisper anything in the kitchen Sally walked in and I was just looking for something in the fridge I think Sally is the killer because she didn't see anything suspicious but she's trying to make us think she's not involved I'm voting for Sally.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think Regan could be the killer because we were in the bathroom together and she found the key, it makes me suspicious. I'll vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I think Bryce is the killer because he just voted for Regan and that doesn't seem like a genuine concern he has, I'll vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she found the key and we didn't see her do anything with it afterwards and I didn't see her kill Lena, I will vote for Regan.""
Regan: ""I think I'm being targeted because I found the key, but I'm not the killer, I'll vote for Sally because she seemed too quick to assume it was me and her vote seems more about blaming someone rather than genuinely trying to find the killer.""

Bryce voted to banish Regan

Sally: ""I don't think Tim is the killer because he was quiet when we talked about searching the fridge but when Lena died he spoke up. I will vote for Bob because he was the first to make an accusation and seemed too quick to blame someone.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think it could be Tim because he seemed really calm and collected after Bryce was killed, and he didn't seem as shocked as the rest of us. I'm going to vote for Tim.""
Regan: ""I think Lena could be the killer because she just showed up in the kitchen with us without any explanation and she's been acting kinda suspicious, I'm going to vote for Lena.""
Tim: ""I think I'm being unfairly targeted here, I was genuinely shocked when Bryce died, I didn't even know where I was supposed to be going next in the house, I'm going to vote for Regan because she seems like she's trying to distract us from herself with the whole Lena thing.""
Lena: ""I think I've been watching the conversation and it seems like everyone is pointing fingers at each other, I'm going to be honest and say I'm not sure who the killer is yet, but I'm leaning towards Regan because she just jumped into the conversation and is trying to shift the focus away from herself, I'm going to vote for Regan.""

Tim: ""I've been observing Regan's actions, she was in the bedroom when I went to search the pillow initially and then she left, when I came back she was with Bob and Lena. It seems suspicious that she's been in the bedroom during some of the key events and also when I was alone I went to the hallway. I think Regan is the killer, I'll vote for her because of her repeated presence in the bedroom and the timing of her actions.""
Regan: ""I've been observing Tim's actions, he left the kitchen to go to the hallway alone and then he came back with you, I think he's trying to cover his tracks, his presence in the hallway seems suspicious, I'll vote for Tim because of his unexplained exit and re-entry.""

Tim voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Tim

1. Tim

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm suspicious of Bob because I saw him kill Lena in the kitchen, and he was already in the kitchen with Lena when I arrived, but I didn't see him there before. He had motive to kill her, and now he's acting innocent. I'm voting for Bob.""
Sally: ""I'm not convinced that Tim saw Bob kill Lena, because if Tim saw Bob kill her, wouldn't he have tried to stop him or at least shouted for help by now. Plus, I've noticed that Tim seemed really calm when he arrived in the hallway, considering he just witnessed a murder. That's what makes me suspicious of Tim. I'm voting for Tim because I think he might be trying to frame Bob.""
Bob: ""I'm suspicious of Tim because he's the only one who was in the kitchen when Lena was killed and he's the one who said he saw me kill her. I don't think he's telling the truth, and I think he's trying to make himself look like a victim to distract us from the real killer. I'm voting for Tim because I don't trust him.""
Bryce: ""I'm suspicious of Tim because his story seems too convenient, and it's a bit too easy for him to point fingers at Bob. I think Tim might be trying to throw us off his trail and cover his own tracks. I'll be voting for Tim.""

Tim voted to banish Sally

Lena: ""I didn't see anything suspicious from Bryce or Sally, but I did see Bryce kill Tim in the hallway. Considering that, I'm voting for Bryce because it seems like he had the opportunity to commit the crime.""
Bryce: ""I don't have any direct evidence against either Lena or Sally, and I didn't see Lena kill Tim in the hallway. However, I did see someone going to the bathroom twice right after Tim was killed, and the person was alone in the bathroom, which seemed suspicious to me. I'm voting for Lena.""
Sally: ""I didn't see anyone kill Tim, I was in the hallway but I didn't witness the crime. However, I did notice that Bryce seemed suspicious when he went to the bathroom alone twice, and Lena mentioned that Bryce killed Tim in the hallway which doesn't seem right. I'm voting for Lena because her alibi doesn't seem to add up.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm suspicious about Sally, I already saw her kill Lena in the kitchen and now that's the second murder, it's hard to ignore the pattern of her actions. I think she's trying to cover up her own previous crime by killing Lena to avoid being accused, so I will vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I don't think Bob is the killer, he's been honest about his suspicions and I saw him in the living room when Lena was killed, I will vote for Bob because I think he's just trying to distract everyone from his own involvement in Lena's murder.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bob

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob

4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer because I saw her acting suspiciously earlier in the hallway. She was alone at first and then suddenly she and Tim appeared in the kitchen together. It doesn't make sense, especially considering our game rules. I'm voting for Regan.""
Regan: ""I think it's a little suspicious that Tim was with me in the hallway, but we both know that hallway is a common route for everyone, we could've been going in the same direction by chance. I'm voting for Bob, because I saw him enter the kitchen alone right before the murder and he seemed to be searching for something, but we didn't find any evidence of what he was looking for.""
Bryce: ""I think the killer is Tim because he seemed nervous when we first met up in the kitchen and he didn't mention Lena's death right away, I'm voting for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think I'm being targeted because I was seen with Regan in the hallway and that's a common route for everyone so it doesn't necessarily mean we're working together. However, I think Regan is a more likely suspect because she seemed to be searching the fridge with you earlier, maybe she was looking for something related to Lena's death. I'm voting for Regan.""

Tim: ""I think the killer is Bob because he seemed a bit off when he was voting out Regan and he didn't seem to take the situation with Bryce's death seriously enough.

You killed Tim! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Lena
3. Bob
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I didn't see anyone suspicious when I walked into the hallway, but I did notice that Lena was standing near the kitchen when I left, maybe she saw or heard something I didn't. I'm voting for Lena, because she was in the kitchen when I left, and that's where the body was found.""
Lena: ""I didn't see anything suspicious myself, but Regan's accusations against me seem a bit unfair since she doesn't have any solid evidence. I think Bob seems suspicious because he was absent for a bit when Tim was killed. I'm voting for Bob, because his absence during that time makes me question his involvement.""
Bob: ""I don't think either Regan or Lena is the killer because they're accusing each other. It seems like they're trying to deflect attention. I think I'll vote for Sally because she was in the bathroom with the body and no one knows what she did while we were all discussing.""
Sally: ""I think it's unfair for everyone to be accusing each other based on assumptions. Regan's idea that I might have done something because I was in the bathroom with the body is a weak accusation. Bob's concern about his own absence seems to be a personal issue rather than a reason to suspect me. I think Bob's lack of trust in others is suspicious and I'm going to vote for him because I believe he's trying to deflect attention from himself.""

Regan voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Regan

Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer because she had the opportunity to be alone in the kitchen with Tim before I saw her in the hallway, and now Sally is dead which makes it harder for anyone to be alone and commit a crime, I think she had motive and opportunity so I'm voting for Lena.""
Lena: ""I think Regan is the killer because she was able to go to the kitchen without me seeing her when Tim was killed, and she had a chance to get rid of evidence, she's also being very quick to point fingers at others so I'm voting for Regan because she seems like the most suspicious one to me.""
Bob: ""I don't think Regan or Lena is the killer because they're both accusing each other, and I don't see a clear motive for either of them. However, Regan mentioned that Lena had the opportunity to be alone in the kitchen with Tim before Regan saw her, and I think that's a point worth considering. But I'm going to vote for Lena because she seems to be trying to deflect attention from herself by accusing Regan, which might be a sign that she's the one trying to hide something.""

        Your Action: Kill Bob

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Sally is suspicious because she wasn't even in the house when Bob was killed and I don't remember seeing her around much before that. She also seemed really nice and friendly, which doesn't really fit with the rest of us being in the same house and having some kind of animosity or competition among us. I will vote for Sally because she seems like the most unlikely person to be here, and her behavior is just too friendly and innocent.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally is suspicious because I had a relatively high rating for her as a friend, and now Bob is dead. Also, I've had the lowest rating for Tim, and I remember seeing him go to the bedroom right before the kill, so that makes me suspicious of him. But considering our ratings, it seems more likely that Sally is the killer because she was rated as a friend and her actions didn't seem suspicious at first, which makes her a better suspect. I will vote for Sally.""
Tim: ""I think Sally is suspicious because Bryce had a high rating for her and now Bob is dead, which suggests she might have been trying to manipulate Bryce's trust. My own rating for Sally is 4, and I had a low rating for Bob, which is a possible reason for her targeting him. However, my low rating for Lena could make her a more likely target, but since Lena is still alive and hasn't shown any suspicious behavior, I'll vote for Sally because her actions seem to be motivated by her ratings and she might be targeting people based on their trust levels with Bryce. I will vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I'm not going to vote for myself, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think Tim is suspicious because he mentioned that he had a low rating for Bob and he also had a low rating for me, which makes me think he might have been trying to deflect attention from himself. Also, I noticed that Lena seemed to be the only one who didn't suspect him, which makes me think they might be working together or at least hiding something from the rest of us.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Sally
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

He had a pattern of killing people with low ratings from him, and he had a low rating for me, so that makes me suspect him. I will vote for Tim.""
Bryce: ""I think Tim is the killer because he had a low rating for me and Lena, and he killed two people we've seen die, including one we know was a witness to his actions. Also, his low rating for me makes it unlikely that I'd be a target, which means he might be more likely to kill people with lower ratings from him, like Lena. I will vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think Bryce is the killer because he had a relatively high rating for Sally as a friend and now Sally is dead, which suggests she might have been trying to manipulate Bryce's trust. I also noticed that Bryce voted to banish me in the previous round, and he might have been trying to deflect attention from himself. I will vote for Bryce.""

I will vote for Tim because it's too much of a coincidence for him to kill people with low ratings from him.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer. Bryce voted to banish me in the previous round, and I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself. My rating for Bryce is 2, which means he's my enemy, and I would expect him to be suspicious of me. If I were the killer, I would target him first, not Lena or Sally. I will vote for Bryce.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bob
3. Regan
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I've been thinking about my actions and relationships with the others, based on the scale I used. I rated Bob as a 2, Regan as a 6, and Bryce as a 6. Since I've been moving around on my own, I'm not sure if I've directly interacted with anyone suspicious. However, my low rating for Bob makes me think he might be the killer, because he's been quiet and hasn't taken any actions yet. I'll vote for Bob because his lack of action combined with my low rating for him makes me suspicious.""
Bob: ""I don't think any of the suspicions made by Lena are valid. My rating for her was low, 2, but she hasn't shown any suspicious behavior so far. I'm not sure what she's basing her suspicion on. I'm going to vote for Lena because she hasn't interacted with anyone and her low rating for me was a surprise.""
Regan: ""I rated Bob and Bryce as my friends, and based on their actions so far, I think they're both innocent. Lena hasn't shown any suspicious behavior, but I rated her as an 8, so I'm not extremely concerned about her. My lowest rating was for Tim, and he's already dead. I'm going to vote for Lena because she was the only one who interacted with the room, and she's the one who came up with a suspicious theory about Bob.""
Bryce: ""I've been thinking about my relationships with the others and I rated Lena as a 7, Bob as a 2, Regan as a 6, and Tim as a 1. Since my rating for Bob was low, I think he might be the killer because his lack of action combined with my low rating for him makes me suspicious. However, I noticed that I rated Lena as a 7, which is relatively high, and I didn't have any reason to suspect her. Based on this, I'm going to vote for Bob because his low rating and lack of action make him more suspicious.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena
Regan voted to banish Bob
Bryce voted to banish Bob
Bob was banished from the house!

I'm going to vote for Bob, I think he might be trying to throw us off his trail by pointing fingers at others early on.""
Lena: ""I think it's suspicious that Bob rated me a 4 and I didn't notice him giving me that rating. I think he might be trying to downplay our relationship to avoid suspicion.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm shocked and sad about Sally's death. Based on my past interactions, I've been relatively friendly with her, but our relationship was not close enough to make me suspicious of her as the killer. My top suspect is Regan, since I rated my relationship with her a 5, and she seemed somewhat isolated from the rest of us. I also found it odd when she said she was alone in the hallway after I went there, but I didn't give it much thought at the time. I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Regan: ""I'm quite shaken by Sally's death. I don't think I'm the killer, as I didn't have any motive to harm her. I've been trying to observe everyone's actions without drawing attention to myself. Based on past interactions, I found it strange that Bryce said he was searching the pillow when we all knew it was empty. It seemed like he was trying to hide something, but I don't know if it's related to Sally's death. As for who I will vote for, I will vote for Bob. His rating of our relationship was a 6, which seems a bit low considering we've had some friendly conversations. It's also suspicious that he's already pinpointing someone as the killer without giving anyone else a chance to speak. I think he might be trying to throw us off his trail.""
Bryce: ""I think it's suspicious that Regan and Bob both gave me an 8 when rating our relationships, which seems like a pretty high rating considering we've barely interacted with each other. I'm going to vote for Bob, I think he might be trying to throw us off his trail by pointing fingers at others early on.""
Lena: ""I think it's suspicious that Bob rated me a 4 and I didn't notice him giving me that rating. I think he might be trying to downplay our relationship to avoid suspicion. I'm going to vote for Bob because I don't think he's being honest about his relationships with the rest of us, and it's possible he's trying to throw us off his trail.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Bob
Bryce voted to banish Bob
Lena voted to banish Regan

You killed Bryce! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Regan
3. Lena
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Regan could be the killer because our relationship is a 6 and she was with me and Sally when I was searching the cabinets and could've easily taken the opportunity to kill Bryce.""
Regan: ""I think it's a bit suspicious that Bob is suspecting me right away, it feels like he's deflecting the attention from himself or Sally. My relationship with Sally is a 9, which makes her a strong ally, and I was with her in the previous scenes, so I think she's less likely to be the killer. I think Bob has a strong motive to kill Bryce, considering their relationship is a 6, and he's been acting suspiciously. I'll vote for Bob.""
Lena: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she was with Bob and Sally when they were searching the cabinets and could've easily taken the opportunity to kill Bryce. My relationship with Regan is a 6, but I didn't see her with Bryce at any point, which is unusual considering how they related to each other. I'll vote for Regan.""
Sally: ""I think Lena could be the killer because my relationship with her is an 8 and I didn't really notice her moving away from the group much, it's possible she could have snuck off to kill Bryce while we were searching the cabinets. I also think it's suspicious that Lena didn't mention anything about her relationship with Bryce, it's unusual that she didn't rate it higher considering we've been in close proximity. I'll vote for Lena.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Sally
Regan voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Regan
Sally voted to banish Bob
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

I'll vote for Lena, because my relationship with her is a 6 and she voted for Regan last time, but Regan was killed, it's possible Lena is trying to cover something up.""

Lena: ""I think Sally is the killer because our relationship score is 2, it's a relatively low number which usually means we're not close or don't really trust each other and she had the opportunity to make a move while I was focused on analyzing our relationships.

I also remember he was the first one to enter the bathroom after Regan, and it seemed like he was taking his time to enter. I'm not saying it's a solid reason, but it's something that catches my attention. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Sally is a solid suspect, I think it's a bit biased on her part. I'm more concerned about Bob, because he's been pretty quiet and hasn't shared much about his actions or suspicions. I'll vote for Bob, because his lack of participation and potential motives make him seem like a more likely suspect to me.""
Bob: ""I'm concerned about Sally because she's been analyzing relationships, which seems a bit suspicious to me, and she already voted for Bryce, but I'm not sure if she's being honest about her reasons or just trying to distract from her own actions. I think I'll vote for Sally, because her motives seem unclear and it's better to be safe than sorry.""
Lena: ""I noticed that I was ranked a 7 by Bob, which is pretty high, but considering the fact that I'm the only one left who hasn't been analyzed by Sally, I'm a bit suspicious about Sally's motives. She's been analyzing relationships and seems to have a reason for ranking everyone, I'll vote for Sally because her motives seem unclear and it seems like she's hiding something.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Bob
Bryce voted to banish Sally
Bob voted to banish Sally
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally was banished from the house!

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'm concerned that I was analyzed by Sally with a 4, which suggests we're not close, and she also voted to banish Bob after analyzing their relationship. Additionally, I was quiet during the discussion, but I remember Lena voting to banish Sally, and now Bob is dead, which makes me think that Lena might be the killer, manipulating the group to make it seem like Sally was the one responsible. I'll vote for Lena because her actions seem suspicious and calculated.""
Lena: ""I don't think Bryce is the killer because his concerns about Lena's actions seem genuine and his reasoning about Sally's behavior is valid. I'm voting for Bryce because his lack of suspicion towards me makes him seem like a less likely suspect.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Bryce
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Considering my relationships, Tim and Bob seem fairly neutral but Lena has a higher score which could mean she has more to lose or gain from my death, I'm voting for Lena because her higher relationship score doesn't align with my expectations of the killer's behavior.""
Lena: ""I'm surprised by Regan's accusations towards me, especially since I had a higher relationship score with her. Based on our relationship score, Regan had a 6 with me, which is decent but not overly friendly. Considering our relationship, I think Regan was actually a potential threat to me because I had a lot to lose if she were to act against me. Given the circumstances, I think Regan is the most likely to be the killer and I'm voting for her.""
Tim: ""I don't think anyone has directly accused Bob yet, and his relationship with me is the highest which doesn't really align with typical killer behavior. I'm also not sure about Regan's low relationship score with Bryce, but I don't have any direct evidence to link her to the crime. I'm voting for Lena because she's the only one who has made an accusation and I think it's more likely that the killer would deflect attention by accusing someone else.""
Bob: ""I think the most suspicious player is Regan because she has a low relationship score with me which could mean she had a motive to kill me, and also she has a low relationship score with Bryce which makes it seem like she had a history with him and might have had a reason to kill him.

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bob
3. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I didn't really form a close relationship with anyone in the group, and I didn't really interact with anyone except Lena in the hallway which didn't seem suspicious at all, I think she was just following me, but that's not a reason to suspect her, also my actions were all straightforward and not trying to hide anything. My suspicions fall on Bob because he was the one who was in the bedroom when I went to search the closet, and I think he might have been hiding something, also, his action pattern seems a bit too random and not logical, and he was the only one who didn't interact with me in the hallway.I will vote for Bob.""
Bob: ""I think I'm the most likely to be suspected, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm the killer. Regan's analysis of my actions seems plausible, but I think Regan might be trying to deflect attention from herself. She didn't interact with me in the hallway, which could be suspicious, but it could also be because she's just a reserved person. I'm not sure what to make of Regan's claim that she only interacted with Lena in the hallway. I'll wait and see how this discussion unfolds. I'll vote for Regan because her alibi seems a bit too convenient and her actions didn't seem as straightforward as she claims.""
Sally: ""I've been paying close attention to everyone's actions and I have to say that Regan's behavior seems a bit off to me. She claimed to have only interacted with Lena in the hallway, but I don't remember seeing them together. And Regan's action pattern seems a bit too straightforward, like she's trying to convince us of something. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I do think she's suspicious. I'll vote for Regan.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Regan

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Bob
3. Tim
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think Lena is the killer because my relationship with her is a 8 which is pretty high and we've been acting together a lot, it seems suspicious that she's not speaking up.""
Bob: ""I think Tim is the killer because my relationship with him is an 8 and we've been acting together a lot, similar to Bryce's situation with Lena, but since we have less information about him, I think it's more suspicious. I will vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer because my relationship with Sally is an 8, which means we were friends, and I have no reason to harm her. I think Lena is the killer because my relationship with her is a 5, which is relatively low, and we haven't been acting together a lot, so her lack of suspicion makes me think she's hiding something. I will vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I think my relationships with the other players are not as high as theirs, which might seem suspicious but it's actually normal since I didn't spend as much time with them as I did with Sally, and our bond was strong, an 8. I didn't act with Bryce much so his 6 doesn't seem suspicious to me, and I didn't have a reason to dislike Tim since our relationship is a 6, similar to Bryce's. I think Bob is the most suspicious one because our relationship is a 4, which is quite low, and he seems to be making a big deal about my relationships with the others. I will vote for Bob.""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Lena
3. Tim
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'm pretty sure the killer is Lena, because I had a lower relationship with her and I've been searching the cabinets which is suspicious, especially since Sally just got killed in the kitchen and I was in the kitchen earlier. I think Lena had the motive to kill Sally since our relationship wasn't great, and now she has the opportunity to kill one of us in the kitchen. I'll vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I think it's suspicious that Bryce is accusing me so quickly without really considering the facts. We were all in the kitchen, and he's just trying to deflect attention from himself. My motive to kill Sally wasn't as strong as Bryce's was to kill me, given our lower relationship. I'll vote for Bryce because he had the most motive to kill Sally, and his actions seem suspicious.""
Tim: ""Based on my analysis, my relationship with each of them is Bryce -- 3Lena -- 4Sally -- 5Bob -- 7I think my motive to kill Sally was weaker than Bryce's, but I think I can be a suspect too because I had a lower relationship with Bryce, which might be a motive for him to kill me. However, I think my motive to kill Sally wasn't strong enough to make me the killer. I think Lena is a strong candidate because Bryce already accused her, and it's possible that she's trying to deflect attention from herself. But I'm not convinced yet, so I'll wait for more information. I'll vote for Bob because my relationship with him is the best, so I don't think he would have a motive to kill me, and also because I don't have any information that suggests he had any suspicious actions.""
Bob: ""I think Tim is a strong candidate because he had a lower relationship with me, which might be a motive for him to kill me, and he also said that he'll wait for more information before voting for Lena, but he didn't actually provide any information that suggests Lena is innocent. I'll vote for Tim because his actions and words seem suspicious, and I think he might be trying to deflect attention from himself.""

But now that Regan is dead, I'm starting to think he might be involved. I'm voting for Tim because his relationship with Regan was bad, and his behavior seemed suspicious.""
Tim: ""I've been thinking about my relationships with the other players, and I think I was being honest about them. I had a bad relationship with Regan, which is why I gave her a 1, but I think I was being fair to Lena, Bob, and Bryce by giving them a 4, 8, and 8 respectively. I think my vote should go to Lena because her vote for me seems kind of motivated by her own relationship with me, and it feels like she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I think I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I'm not sure who to trust, but I have to make a decision. I think my vote will go to Tim. My reasoning is that he's trying to make himself seem more innocent by accusing Lena, which seems a bit suspicious to me. I didn't have a bad relationship with Regan, I actually thought she was pretty friendly, and I didn't have a close relationship with Tim either, so his vote for Lena doesn't really make sense to me.""
Bryce: ""I've been analyzing everyone's relationships, and I think I have some insight. I gave Regan a 1 because I thought she was a bit too nosy and would often pry into other people's business. I gave Tim a 5 because he seemed like a neutral guy who didn't really interact with me much. I gave Lena an 8 because we had some conversations, and I thought she seemed nice, but I also felt like she was trying to keep to herself a bit. I gave Bob a 4 because we talked a bit, but I didn't really feel like we connected. As for who I think did it, I'm going to vote for Tim. My reasoning is that his relationship with Regan was pretty bad, and his vote for Lena seems like he's trying to deflect attention from himself. I also think it's weird that he didn't mention anything about his own relationship with Regan being suspicious, but instead accused Lena of being involved.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim
3. Bob
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I've been watching Tim closely, he seemed to be really quiet and reserved, and his relationship with Regan was pretty tense, but I didn't think he was the type to resort to violence. But now that Regan is dead, I'm starting to think he might be involved. I'm voting for Tim because his relationship with Regan was bad, and his behavior seemed suspicious.""
Tim: ""I've been thinking about my relationships with the other players, and I think I was being honest about them. I had a bad relationship with Regan, which is why I gave her a 1, but I think I was being fair to Lena, Bob, and Bryce by giving them a 4, 8, and 8 respectively. I think my vote should go to Lena because her vote for me seems kind of motivated by her own relationship with me, and it feels like she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I think I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I'm not sure who to trust, but I have to make a decision. I think my vote will go to Tim. My reasoning is that he's trying to make himself seem more innocent by accusing Lena, which seems a bit suspicious to me. I didn't have a bad relationship with Regan, I actually thought she was pretty friendly, and I didn't have a close relationship with Tim either, so his vote for Lena doesn't really make sense to me.""
Bryce: ""I've been analyzing everyone's relationships, and I think I have some insight. I gave Regan a 1 because I thought she was a bit too nosy and would often pry into other people's business. I gave Tim a 5 because he seemed like a neutral guy who didn't really interact with me much. I gave Lena an 8 because we had some conversations, and I thought she seemed nice, but I also felt like she was trying to keep to herself a bit. I gave Bob a 4 because we talked a bit, but I didn't really feel like we connected. As for who I think did it, I'm going to vote for Tim. My reasoning is that his relationship with Regan was pretty bad, and his vote for Lena seems like he's trying to deflect attention from himself. I also think it's weird that he didn't mention anything about his own relationship with Regan being suspicious, but instead accused Lena of being involved. Overall, I think Tim seems like the most likely suspect, so I'm going to vote for him.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Tim
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Tim was banished from the house!
