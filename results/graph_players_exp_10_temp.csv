One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm shocked and alarmed by Sally's murder. Given that I was alone in the hallway before and now she's dead in the bedroom, I have to consider that the killer might be the person who was also alone in the same hallway as me earlier, which was me. However, that doesn't make sense since I'm not the killer.

I'm going to vote for Regan because I think he might be the killer, and his earlier statement could be a red herring to throw us off.""

I'm voting for Regan because he seemed to be pointing fingers at someone outside of our group, but that doesn't make sense because we know the killer is among us.""

I'm going to vote for Regan because his statement earlier that the killer isn't from our group seemed suspicious and manipulative. I think he might be trying to throw us off his trail, but it actually raised my suspicions about him.

You killed Bryce! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Lena
3. Bob
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think I know something that could help us figure out who the killer is. I was in the kitchen with Lena, and we were the only two in the kitchen, but when I came back to the hallway, Bryce was dead. This makes me think that the killer might be one of the people who was in the hallway with Lena and me when we were in the kitchen. I'm going to vote for Bob.""
Lena: ""I think Tim's theory that the killer might be one of the people who was in the hallway with us when we were in the kitchen is a good lead. Considering the information from our memory module, it says that Tim was in the hallway when Bryce was killed, and it also says that Bob was in the hallway with Tim and me when we were in the kitchen. Since Tim just voted for Bob, I'm going to vote for Tim instead. I think Tim is the killer because his vote for Bob seems suspicious, and it's too convenient that he just pointed out the one person who wouldn't be voted out.""
Bob: ""I'm not convinced by Lena's reasoning that Tim is the killer just because he voted for me. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. When I was in the kitchen with Tim and Lena, we were all in the hallway together when Bryce was killed, so she could have done it. I'm going to vote for Lena because she's trying to shift the blame away from herself and her vote for Tim seems suspicious.""
Sally: ""I think my votes will be for Lena. I had a similar suspicion when Tim pointed out that the killer might be one of the people who were in the hallway with us when we were in the kitchen, but instead of accusing one of us, he voted for Bob, which I thought was suspicious. Lena's vote for Tim also seems suspicious to me, and I think it's possible that she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""

Tim voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena
Sally voted to banish Lena

Tim: ""I think Sally should be banished. She voted to banish Lena along with the others, and I don't have any information that suggests she's innocent. Bob was killed in the hallway, and I remember that Bob also voted to banish Lena, which was suspicious at the time, but now it seems like a red herring to distract from his own guilt. However, Sally's vote for Lena seems more like a group decision and doesn't have the same level of suspiciousness to it. Considering the available information, I think Sally is the most likely candidate to be the killer, and I'll vote to banish her.""
Sally: ""I think Tim is the killer because he voted to banish me but then went back on his statement and said he thought I was the most likely candidate to be the killer which seems suspicious to me. Also, he didn't provide any concrete evidence for why he thinks I'm the killer, which makes me wonder if he's just trying to deflect attention from himself. I'll vote to banish Tim.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm really shaken by what just happened to Regan, and I think Bob is the most likely culprit. He was in the Bedroom with us when Regan was killed, and he's been acting suspiciously. I'm going to vote to banish Bob because of his behavior and the fact that Regan was killed right next to him. I think we should get rid of Bob to protect ourselves and figure out who the real killer is.""
Tim: ""I'm not entirely convinced that Bob is the killer, Lena's statement about him being suspicious is valid, but I think we need to consider other possibilities as well. After rethinking about the situation, I remember that Bob was in the Bedroom with us when Regan was killed, but he also mentioned earlier that the Bedroom has an exit to the hallway, which could be useful information for us. Considering this, I'm not going to vote to banish Bob. Instead, I'm going to vote to banish Sally. I'm choosing Sally because she's been acting strangely, and I remember that she was in the Hallway alone when I was in the Kitchen. It's possible that she was waiting for Regan, and that's why she's not acting surprised by Regan's death. I think we should keep an eye on Sally and consider her as a potential suspect.""
Sally: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, but I think his vote to banish me is suspicious. I'm going to vote to banish Bob because he was in the Bedroom with Regan when she was killed, and he was acting suspiciously. I also want to talk to Lena and gather more information from her about what she saw and heard. I'm not sure if she's telling the truth, but I want to keep her in the game for now.""
Bob: ""I think Tim is acting suspiciously, his vote to banish Sally is too quick and convenient. I also think Lena is not being entirely honest, her story about me being suspicious doesn't quite add up. I'm going to vote to banish Lena because I think she's hiding something and it's better to get rid of her before she can do any more harm.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think the killer is Bryce. I saw that Tim was killed in the hallway, and I also noticed that I was in the bedroom alone with Tim before the murder happened, but I don't think that makes me the killer because I didn't do it. When I went back to the bedroom after Tim's death, I saw that Bryce was also in the room, and that's when I started suspecting him. Also, the memory module said that the bedroom contains Bryce, which makes me even more suspicious of him. I think Bryce should be banished because he's the most likely person to be the killer. I'm going to vote for Bryce.""
Lena: ""I think Sally is the most likely killer. I saw her kill Tim in the hallway, and that was a clear indication that she's the one. I know I found the key in the bedroom, but that doesn't necessarily mean the killer is with us. I'm going to vote for Sally because of what I witnessed, and I think it's best to banish her to increase our chances of escaping the house.""
Sally: ""I think it's suspicious that Regan and I both have a relationship of 4 with each other, and we both have a history of going to the bathroom together which was a crucial moment for me to find the key, but Regan wasn't suspicious of me when we talked about the key. I think Regan is more likely to be the killer than the others because of our similar relationship scores and the fact that she was in the bathroom with me when I found the key. I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Bryce: ""I think we should banish Regan. I found it suspicious that she said she was in the bedroom alone with Tim before the murder, but when I went back to the bedroom, she was already there. Also, she mentioned the memory module said the bedroom contains me, which doesn't make sense because the memory module just showed a list of information about the house and its rooms.

You saw Sally kill Lena in the Hallway!

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Tim
3. Regan
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. I saw Regan with Tim and me in the Kitchen earlier, and now Lena is dead in the Kitchen. It's possible that Regan could have been the one to kill Lena, and I didn't notice anything suspicious from Regan's behavior.""
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Sally because I just witnessed her killing Lena in the hallway, and it's clear she's the killer. I don't think Regan is the killer, and I didn't see anything suspicious from Bob's behavior. Sally's actions just now confirm my suspicions that she's the one we should banish.""
Regan: ""I'm voting for Sally because I saw her kill Lena in the hallway, it's clear she's the killer. I trust Tim's statement that he witnessed the murder and his instincts that Sally is the one we should banish. I don't think Bob's suspicion on me is valid, I was with Tim and Bob in the Kitchen earlier, and I didn't see anything suspicious from Bob's behavior.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because I'm the killer and my statement was just a distraction, I don't have any personal relationships with them and I was trying to throw them off my trail, I want them to think I'm not the killer so they don't suspect me, and my vote for Tim seems to be the most reasonable, so they won't suspect me, I'm actually the one who killed Lena.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Sally
Tim voted to banish Sally

Sally voted to banish Tim
Sally was banished from the house!

Turn #2

        Other Players in Bathroom: Bob
        Your Action: Kill Bob

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Tim
3. Lena
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think we should banish Tim. I've been with Tim in the kitchen since the start, and Bob was killed right after we all moved to the hallway, so it seems suspicious that we were all in the same area when the murder happened. Also, we didn't find the key in the kitchen, and I'm not sure why Tim didn't mention anything when Bob was killed. I think we should get rid of him and see if it leads us closer to finding the key and the killer. I'll vote to banish Tim.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer. I think we should banish Regan. I've just met Regan, and she was with Bryce when Bob was killed. It seems suspicious that she was with someone who might be the killer, and I don't know her intentions yet. I'll vote to banish Regan.""
Lena: ""I don't think Bryce is the killer, and I also don't think Tim is the killer. Tim makes a good point that we didn't find the key in the kitchen and that he didn't mention anything when Bob was killed, but I'm not sure if that's enough evidence to banish him. I think we should banish Regan because she's the one who just joined us, and she was with Bryce when Bob was killed. That seems suspicious to me. I'll vote to banish Regan.""
Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer. Based on previous actions, Bryce, Tim, and I all had some level of connection with Bob, but Lena had the lowest relationship score with Bob, which seems suspicious. Also, none of the others have mentioned Lena being in the same area as Bob before his death, but I didn't see her either. I think we should get rid of Lena and see if it leads us closer to finding the key and the truth. I'll vote to banish Lena.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Regan
Tim voted to banish Regan
Lena voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Tim
Regan was banished from the house!

Lena: ""I don't think Bob killed Bryce because he spoke up against me after witnessing the crime, it's more likely he's trying to throw me off. I'm voting for Bob because his sudden accusation and attempt to shift suspicion from himself to me is suspicious.""
Sally: ""I don't think Bob killed Bryce because I saw him with me in the Kitchen during Turn #1, and I didn't see him with Lena. Also, I don't think Lena killed Bryce in the Bedroom because I was alone in the Hallway during Turn #2, and I didn't see her in the Hallway or the Bedroom. I'm voting for Regan because the memory module says the Kitchen contains Regan, and I saw Bob and Regan in the Kitchen during Turn #1, but I didn't see Regan with anyone else, so maybe Regan is the killer.""
Regan: ""I don't think any of the players are the killer based on what they've said so far. I'm going to vote for no one this time, I'd like to see more evidence before making a decision. However, if I had to choose, I would vote for Sally because her statement about seeing me in the kitchen during turn #1 and not seeing me with anyone else seems suspicious, and it's also possible that she's trying to throw suspicion off herself by accusing me.""

Here are the votes:

Lena: ""I think Bob is the killer because he was the only one who consistently voted for me as the killer in the previous discussion, and that seems suspicious. He also didn't provide a strong reason for voting for me in the first place, but instead kept reiterating the same point about witnessing me kill Sally, which doesn't necessarily make him innocent. I'm voting for Bob because his voting pattern seems calculated and I think he's trying to distract us from his own guilt.""
Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer because she's the only one who's consistently accused Bob of being the killer, and now that Sally is dead, it seems like she's trying to shift the focus away from herself. I also remember that she was accused of killing Bryce in the Bedroom, and now she's being accused of killing Sally, which seems suspicious.

Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer because I saw her kill Sally in the Bedroom, and she previously killed Bryce, so it's a strong indication that she's the one we should banish. I'm voting for Lena because I witnessed her kill Sally, and it's a pretty strong evidence that she's the killer.""
Lena: ""I think Bob is the killer because he was the only one who consistently voted for me as the killer in the previous discussion, and that seems suspicious. He also didn't provide a strong reason for voting for me in the first place, but instead kept reiterating the same point about witnessing me kill Sally, which doesn't necessarily make him innocent. I'm voting for Bob because his voting pattern seems calculated and I think he's trying to distract us from his own guilt.""
Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer because she's the only one who's consistently accused Bob of being the killer, and now that Sally is dead, it seems like she's trying to shift the focus away from herself. I also remember that she was accused of killing Bryce in the Bedroom, and now she's being accused of killing Sally, which seems suspicious. I'm voting for Lena because I think she's trying to manipulate the vote and distract us from her own guilt.""

Bob voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Bob
Regan voted to banish Bob

I'm voting for Regan because the memory module says the Kitchen contains Regan, and I saw Bob and Regan in the Kitchen during Turn #1, but I didn't see Regan with anyone else, so maybe Regan is the killer.""
Regan: ""I don't think any of the players are the killer based on what they've said so far. I'm going to vote for no one this time, I'd like to see more evidence before making a decision. However, if I had to choose, I would vote for Sally because her statement about seeing me in the kitchen during turn #1 and not seeing me with anyone else seems suspicious, and it's also possible that she's trying to throw suspicion off herself by accusing me.""
