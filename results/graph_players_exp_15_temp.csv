You're the killer! You cannot search for the key. You must kill the other players.

Turn #2

        Other Players in Kitchen: Bryce and Lena
        Your Action: Kill Lena

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bryce
3. Sally
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think Bryce is the most likely suspect. He's been in the kitchen with me twice now, and Lena was just killed there. I know I'm in the kitchen, but I think it's suspicious that two players are already in this room.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan is the killer, but she's definitely trying to distract us from herself by accusing me. I'm going to vote for Tim, because I don't know much about him, and the only time we interacted was when we were both in the hallway together, which could be a coincidence or something more. I'm also considering the fact that Regan seems to be trying to throw suspicion off herself and onto me. I think we should vote for Tim and see if he's the killer or not.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Regan because I saw her kill Lena in the kitchen, and it seems suspicious that she's now accusing Bryce and trying to distract us from herself. I think it's possible that Regan is trying to make us doubt each other while she waits for her next opportunity to kill again. I'm not sure if Bryce is innocent or not, but I don't think he's the most suspicious one right now, and I think we should be more cautious with Regan.""
Tim: ""I'm not sure if I'm the killer or not, but I have to say that I don't think any of you are perfect suspects either. However, after listening to your arguments, I'm going to vote for Bryce. The reason I'm doing this is that you've all mentioned Regan being suspicious because she was in the kitchen with Lena, but the information from the memory module says that Bryce was in the hallway and then moved to the bedroom, and that's exactly where Lena was killed. This makes me think that maybe Bryce's alibi isn't as solid as he claims it is.""

Regan: ""I think Tim is the most suspicious one now that Sally is dead. The information from the memory module suggests that Bryce was banished, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was the killer. I'm going to vote for Tim because I don't want him to be in the same room as me anymore, and I think it's a good opportunity to get rid of him before he gets suspicious of me.""
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan because she was accused by Sally and Bryce, and she seems to be trying to manipulate the situation by accusing them of being the killer. The fact that Sally saw her kill Lena in the kitchen makes me highly suspicious of her, and I don't think it's a coincidence that she's now trying to deflect attention from herself.

        Your Action: Go to the Bedroom

You saw Bryce kill Bob in the Hallway!

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Sally
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we should banish Tim. When I was in the hallway, I didn't see Sally but I saw Tim. And then I saw Tim alone in the hallway again after I left the bedroom where Bob was killed. I think this is suspicious and I believe Tim might be the killer.""
Tim: ""I think Regan is suspicious, her statement about me being the killer doesn't add up and she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I'll vote to banish Regan, I don't think she's telling the truth and I think she's trying to frame me.""
Sally: ""I think we should banish Bryce, I saw him kill Bob in the hallway and that's a pretty clear indication of his guilt, I'm voting for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think the group is focusing on the wrong person, Regan's statement about Tim doesn't make sense and she's trying to deflect attention from herself, but I don't think Tim is the killer, I think Regan is. I saw Sally accusing me of killing Bob, but I know I didn't kill Bob in front of her, I think she's trying to frame me. I'll vote to banish Sally because I think she's the most suspicious and she's making false accusations against me.""

Regan voted to banish Bryce
Tim voted to banish Regan

Bryce was banished from the house!

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. When we first got into the bathroom, I searched the shower and she didn't say anything or help me, she just stood there. Now that Bryce is dead, I'm suspicious of her because she didn't seem to care when I was searching for the key, and she's been acting really calm the whole time. I think she might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Tim. When Bryce was killed, I was in the kitchen with Sally, and I didn't see anyone else near Bryce. The fact that Tim was the one who first suggested we search the bathroom, but then didn't seem to be paying much attention to the rest of the group, makes me think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Regan: ""I'm going to vote for Tim. I searched the shower with him when we first got into the bathroom, and he didn't seem to be looking for the key. He just suggested searching the shower and then stood there. When Bryce was killed, he seemed suspicious to me because he quickly accused me of being the killer, but he didn't seem to be paying much attention to the rest of the group, like he was trying to distract us. I think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Tim, I don't think he was searching for the key when he was in the bathroom with Regan, and he quickly accused her of being the killer which seems suspicious to me, and also Bob's statement about him not paying much attention to the rest of the group when Bryce was killed makes me think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""

Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's been trying to deflect suspicion from himself by accusing others and I'm not convinced by his calm demeanor after Sally's death, it seems like he's been playing a role to avoid suspicion but I think he might have been the one who killed Sally.""

Bob: ""I'm shocked by what happened to Regan, and I think we should focus on finding the real killer. I'm going to vote for Tim, because he accused me of being the killer and trying to distract everyone, which makes me think he's trying to throw us off his own scent. I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself and pin it on me, so I'm going to banish him to protect myself and figure out who the real killer is.""
Bryce: ""I'm going to vote for Lena, because she just accused Tim of killing Regan, but then said she saw Tim kill Regan in the kitchen. That doesn't make sense and sounds like a weak alibi to me. It seems like Lena is trying to deflect attention from herself and I think she's a stronger suspect.""
