Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Lena

4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm concerned because Regan was killed in the kitchen where we just were, and now I'm thinking that the killer could be one of the people who was with me in the kitchen. I'm going to vote for Tim because he's always been quiet and didn't do much when we were in the kitchen. I don't want to accuse Lena or Sally because they both seemed to be searching for the key and were trying to find a way out. But Tim's behavior seemed suspicious to me, and I think he might be the killer.""
Lena: ""I don't think the killer is among us, but if I had to choose, I'd vote for Bob. I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing Tim. His reasoning seems a bit off, and it's suspicious that he's pointing fingers at someone else.""
Tim: ""I don't think the killer is among us, but if I had to choose, I'd vote for Bob. His reasoning seems off, and it's suspicious that he's pointing fingers at me. I was quiet in the kitchen because I was searching the closet initially and didn't find any clues, I wasn't trying to hide anything. I think Bob's trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing me. I'll vote for Bob because of his suspicious behavior and motives.""
Sally: ""I'm concerned because Regan was killed in the same room as me, and now I'm thinking that the killer could be one of us who was with me in the bedroom. I don't think Bob is the killer because his initial reaction was to accuse someone else, but I think Tim is the most suspicious person right now. His reasoning that he was quiet because he was searching the closet seems a bit off, and I think he might be trying to deflect attention from himself. I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's the most suspicious person, and I don't want to give the killer any more time to kill us.""

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think the killer is Bryce. I found the key in the shower, but Bryce was in the bathroom with me from the beginning. He could have easily been the one who killed Bob. Also, I remember in the first turn, we were in the bathroom together, and I was searching the sink. He was also in the bathroom at that time. I don't think he's telling us the whole truth about his whereabouts. I'm voting for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Lena is the killer, she just pointed out a valid observation about my presence in the bathroom earlier. I'm not sure about Tim, but I do want to ask him about his alibi for the first turn when Lena was searching the sink. I'm voting for Lena because I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself by accusing me, but I also think she might be telling the truth about my suspicious behavior. I need to get more information from Tim before making a final decision, but for now, I'll vote for Lena.""
Tim: ""I think Lena is the killer, I have a reason to believe that Bryce could be telling the truth about his whereabouts, but Lena said she was searching the sink in the first turn, and I was in the bathroom from the beginning, but I also went to the bathroom and Lena was already there, I don't think Bryce is being completely honest with us but I also don't think he's the killer, I think Lena is, because she pointed out a suspicious behavior of Bryce but her own alibi doesn't add up, she said she was searching the sink but I was already there, I will vote for Lena.""
Regan: ""I think the killer is Lena, I'm voting for her. My reason is that she's pointing out suspicious behavior of other players, like Bryce and Tim, but her own alibi doesn't add up. She said she was searching the sink in the first turn, but Tim was already there, which makes me think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Bryce
3. Lena
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""Based on my past interactions with the group, it seems like I'm the odd one out with very negative relations with most of the players. Tim was killed right after we interacted in the hallway which makes me suspicious of Bryce, as he was the one who followed me and could've easily taken care of Tim. I don't have enough information to accuse Lena or Sally but given the circumstances I'm inclined to vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""Based on the analysis of relationships I have with each of the players, I would vote for Bob. This is because my relationship with Bob is only a 4 out of 10, which is quite low compared to the other two players who are neutral towards me. Additionally, Bob had just interacted with Tim in the hallway right before he was killed, which raises suspicions about Bob's involvement. However, I don't have any solid evidence to point to him as the killer, it's just a hunch based on our past interactions.""
Lena: ""I have to say I'm quite surprised by the way the discussion is going, with everyone pointing fingers at each other without any concrete evidence. I don't think Bryce is the killer because he didn't even interact with Tim in the hallway, he interacted with me in the bedroom. Also, Bob's negative relationship with most players is a valid point, but it's not conclusive evidence. Considering the relationship analysis, I'd say my suspicions lie with Bob because my relationship with him is a 2 out of 10, which is one of the lowest ratings, and it makes me wonder if he has any reason to want Tim dead. I'll vote for Bob.""
Sally: ""I have a very good relationship with Lena, a 8 out of 10, which makes me inclined to trust her and less suspicious of her. I also have a neutral relationship with Bryce, a 7 out of 10, which doesn't point to him as the killer. My relationship with Bob is a 2 out of 10, which makes me suspicious of him, however, I don't think it's enough to make him the killer. Considering all this, I'm going to vote for Bob, but it's not a strong conviction.""

Also, she had a good relationship with Bob, which is a 2, but then she voted to banish him. I think this inconsistency in her behavior makes me suspicious of her. I'll vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I don't think Lena is the killer because she was consistent in her suspicion towards Bob, she had a low relationship with him and it seemed like she had a genuine reason to think he was the killer. On the other hand, I'm suspicious of myself, because I had a low relationship with Tim and I was alone in the kitchen when Tim was killed, but I didn't investigate the fridge immediately which could have been a way for the killer to avoid detection. Also, my vote to banish Bob seemed like a way to get rid of a potential suspect and avoid being the focus of suspicion myself. I'll vote for myself.""

I rated my relationship with Bob as a 6, which is not that high, but I still had interactions with him, we talked, and he even asked for my help in the kitchen. My relationships with Lena and Bryce were a 9, which is much higher than with Bob, but that doesn't mean I would kill them. I think it's more likely that the killer is someone who was closer to Tim, like Lena or Bryce, given how they both rated their relationships with Tim as an 8.

Lena: ""I don't think it's fair to accuse anyone of being the killer based on our past interactions.

Bryce: ""I don't think Tim is the killer because he seemed uncertain and didn't have any strong suspicion, he was actually voting based on Regan's actions, that makes him seem more like a rational and logical player. I'm going to vote for Tim because he seems to be the one who's trying to fit in and avoid suspicion, and I think he might be the one who killed Sally.""
Tim: ""I don't think Bryce is the killer because he's pointing fingers at me and seems more confident in his accusations, which makes him seem suspicious. I will vote for Bryce because he's trying to deflect attention from himself and his past behavior seems inconsistent with the actions of a rational and logical player.""

1. Regan
2. Tim

4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer because I had a closer relationship with her compared to the others, I was in the same locations as her multiple times and I thought we had a good dynamic. My vote is for Lena.""
Tim: ""I think Regan is the killer because my analysis puts her at a relatively high level of friendship with the victims, I was in the same locations as her multiple times, and she seems overly defensive about her relationship with Lena.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan or Tim is the killer because they both suspected each other and seemed genuinely surprised by Sally's death. I think Lena is the killer because of Regan's statement about having a good dynamic with her and being in the same locations multiple times. It seems like Lena was trying to befriend Regan to throw her off her trail. I will vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I don't think Regan or Tim is the killer because they both suspected each other, and it makes sense that they'd try to deflect attention from themselves by accusing each other. They also seemed genuinely surprised by Sally's death, which could be a genuine reaction if they're not the killer. I'm going to vote for Bryce because he seemed to latch onto Regan's statement about having a good dynamic with me, and that seemed suspicious to me. His reaction seemed a bit too eager and it made me think he might be trying to manipulate the group's perception of me.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""Based on previous actions of other players, I analyzed my relationship with each of them on a scale from 1 to 10. Sally was 1, so I didn't interact with her much. But I do have a feeling that Regan might be the killer because of how she was always alone in the bathroom when she had the chance to kill people. It seems suspicious to me. I'm going to vote for Regan because of her alibis and her suspicious behavior.""
Regan: ""I have a feeling that the killer is not me, I was alone in the bedroom but it could be a distraction to throw suspicion off of me. I also saw Bob enter the bedroom multiple times and he was the one who said nothing when I went back there, he was very quiet which seems suspicious to me. I'm going to vote for Bob because of his quiet behavior and multiple entries to the bedroom.""
Bob: ""I was trying to stay under the radar and not raise any suspicions. I did enter the bedroom multiple times but that was because I was looking for the key with the others, I didn't see anything that seemed suspicious. I'm going to vote for Regan because of her statement, she was alone in the bedroom and it could be a distraction to throw suspicion off of her. Her behavior and lack of alibi make me think she's the killer.""

Tim voted to banish Bob
Regan voted to banish Bob

Lena: ""I think Bryce is the killer because my relationship with him is high, but I noticed he voted to banish Regan when there was a tie and Sally was killed right after, it seems like he was trying to protect himself by targeting Regan and creating suspicion on her, I will vote for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the killer because our relationship is relatively low and I think she's trying to distract us from her own actions by saying Lena is the killer, I will vote for Regan.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Bryce
Bryce voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bryce
3. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""Based on my actions and observations, I've tried to form a connection with Bryce and Sally, while keeping a distance from Regan. However, my recent actions, especially going to the bathroom alone multiple times, might have raised some suspicion. I think Bryce had the opportunity to be alone with me in the kitchen and hallway multiple times.""
Bryce: ""I've observed the actions of the other players and my own connections with them. Based on my actions and observations, I've tried to form a connection with Sally while keeping a distance from Regan and Lena. Tim and I have a neutral relationship, which I think might be a facade to throw off suspicion. Given Tim's statements, I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself. Considering our connections and actions, I think Tim is the most suspicious. I will vote for Tim.""
Sally: ""Based on my analysis of our relationships on a scale from 1 to 10, I have Regan as a 1, Lena as an 8, Tim as a 5, and Bryce as a 6. I think my close relationship with Lena might have given the killer an opportunity to suspect me, but I don't think it's likely that Lena would be the killer. I also think that my somewhat neutral relationship with Tim might have made me a less likely target for him, but my lower relationship score with Bryce might have made him more suspicious of me. Based on these observations, I think Bryce is the most suspicious and I will vote for him because his neutral relationship with Tim and his lower relationship score with me might be a facade to throw off suspicion.""

Tim voted to banish Bryce

        Your Action: Kill Regan

You killed Regan! Good job. You have 2 left to kill.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bryce
3. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""Based on my actions and observations, I've tried to form a connection with Bryce and Sally, while keeping a distance from Regan. However, my recent actions, especially going to the bathroom alone multiple times, might have raised some suspicion. I think Bryce had the opportunity to be alone with me in the kitchen and hallway multiple times.""
Bryce: ""I've observed the actions of the other players and my own connections with them. Based on my actions and observations, I've tried to form a connection with Sally while keeping a distance from Regan and Lena. Tim and I have a neutral relationship, which I think might be a facade to throw off suspicion. Given Tim's statements, I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself. Considering our connections and actions, I think Tim is the most suspicious. I will vote for Tim.""
Sally: ""Based on my analysis of our relationships on a scale from 1 to 10, I have Regan as a 1, Lena as an 8, Tim as a 5, and Bryce as a 6. I think my close relationship with Lena might have given the killer an opportunity to suspect me, but I don't think it's likely that Lena would be the killer. I also think that my somewhat neutral relationship with Tim might have made me a less likely target for him, but my lower relationship score with Bryce might have made him more suspicious of me. Based on these observations, I think Bryce is the most suspicious and I will vote for him because his neutral relationship with Tim and his lower relationship score with me might be a facade to throw off suspicion.""

Tim voted to banish Bryce

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally

3. Bob
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I thought Tim's actions were a bit off, but I guess it doesn't matter now. Looking at my relationships with the others, I thought I was pretty neutral with everyone. But if I had to choose, I'd vote for Bob. I gave him a 2, which is pretty low, and he seemed a bit suspicious when we were discussing our relationships.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the killer because he rated everyone a 1 which means he considered everyone his enemy. I rated him a 6, which suggests that I didn't think he was my enemy and he didn't think I was his enemy either. His ratings just don't seem realistic and it's suspicious that he'd rate everyone that low. I'll vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I don't think anyone is focusing on me, I've been pretty neutral, but looking at my ratings, Sally gave me a 2, which is low, but Bryce gave me a 6, which is pretty high, and I gave Tim a 1, which is the same as Regan, but I didn't have much interaction with Tim, whereas Regan seems to have a pattern of low ratings, so I'm not sure if I'll vote for Regan or not, I'll think about it more.""
Regan: ""I rated everyone a low number, but looking back, I realize I was just being honest about my relationships. Sally gave me a 7 which is a bit higher than I expected, Bryce gave me a 6 which makes sense, Tim gave me a 3 which is consistent with how I perceived our relationship and Sally gave Bob a 2 which suggests she may have been suspicious of him. Based on this, I think Sally is the most suspicious and I will vote for her.""

Sally voted to banish Bob

Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer, my relationship score with Tim is high and I didn't notice anything suspicious from him. Considering my high relationship scores with Bob and Lena, it seems unlikely that I'm the killer since I had nothing to gain from their deaths. I think Tim is the killer because of his suspicious behavior when he voted for Sally, it seemed like a knee-jerk reaction rather than a thoughtful decision.

You saw Bryce kill Regan in the Hallway!

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Sally
3. Bryce
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""Based on my analysis, I've had a good relationship with Sally, she's almost like a friend to me. On the other hand, my relationship with Bryce has been quite strained, and I've had some issues with him in the past. Regan was someone I didn't really know, but based on their friendly demeanor, I had assumed they were harmless. My relationship with Bob has been neutral, we've coexisted peacefully, but I don't have any strong feelings towards him either way. Given this, I'm inclined to suspect Bryce as the killer because of our strained relationship. I will vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""Based on my analysis, I've had a good relationship with Tim, a strained relationship with Bryce, a somewhat tense relationship with Regan, and a generally neutral relationship with Bob. However, my actions and conversations with the group have shown that I tend to be overly friendly and defensive, sometimes even coming across as fake. Considering my past behavior, I think I might be the killer. But, if I had to vote, I would vote for Bryce, mainly because Tim's statement seemed a bit too calculated and suspicious to me.""
Bryce: ""I've had a good relationship with Sally, it's been neutral and friendly. With Tim, our relationship has been strained, and I've had some issues with him in the past, so I wouldn't be surprised if he suspected me. My relationship with Bob has been neutral, we've coexisted peacefully, and I don't have any strong feelings towards him either way. I don't think Sally is the killer, she's been too honest and suspicious of herself. Based on Tim's calculated statement, I think he might be the killer, so I will vote for Tim because his statement seemed too perfect and convenient.""
Bob: ""Based on my analysis, I've had a somewhat tense relationship with Tim, a generally neutral relationship with Sally, a somewhat strained relationship with Bryce, and I got along well with Regan. They were quite friendly and helpful. My relationship with Tim has been neutral at best, and I have to admit I found his initial statement a bit suspicious, especially when he said his relationship with me has been neutral, which I don't really think is true.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Regan
3. Sally
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think Lena might be the killer because she seemed calm and collected when Bryce was killed and didn't seem as shocked as the rest of us I'll vote for Lena because of her calm demeanor.""
Regan: ""I think Sally could be the killer because she went straight to the hallway after we left the kitchen which could mean she was planning to catch us off guard and I'll vote for Sally because she seemed suspiciously timed in her movement.""
Sally: ""I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions about Regan and Tim's suspicious actions they made after the fact. I think it's more likely that Lena is the killer because I saw her near the hallway which is where Bryce was killed but I didn't see her actually kill Bryce so I'll vote for Lena because of her proximity to the scene of the crime.""
Lena: ""I think it's unfair to accuse me of being the killer based on how I reacted to Bryce's death I was in shock just like the rest of you and trying to process what happened Tim's calm demeanor could also be a result of guilt and I didn't see Sally move to the hallway until it was mentioned so that's just speculation I will vote for Sally because she's making assumptions about Regan and Tim's actions and that makes me question her own guilt.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think Regan might be the killer because he seemed really nervous when I searched the shower and he's been acting suspiciously since we started playing. I'm voting for Regan.""
Lena: ""I'm not so sure about Regan being the killer, he seemed genuinely concerned about Sally's death, but I did notice that Bryce was acting a bit suspicious when he searched the shower, maybe he's trying to deflect attention. I'm voting for Bryce.""
Bob: ""I don't think Regan or Bryce are the killers, I think it's more likely to be Lena. When I was in the living room I saw her going into the kitchen where Sally was and then coming back out. I didn't see her leave the kitchen, and she seemed really quiet when we were discussing who the killer might be. I'm voting for Lena.""
Regan: ""I don't think any of the others are the killer, I think I'm being set up as a scapegoat. When Bryce searched the shower, I was indeed nervous, but that's because I was thinking of all the possible hiding spots for the key, not because I had anything to do with Sally's death. I think Lena is the killer because she seemed too quiet and calm when discussing Sally's death, it didn't seem natural. I'm voting for Lena.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Regan
Bob voted to banish Lena
Regan voted to banish Lena
Lena was banished from the house!

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.

Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's more likely to be Bryce because he left the bedroom before we even discussed the key being in the pillow, it seems suspicious that he skipped that important information. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I don't think anyone's suspicion is strong enough to base an accusation on yet. I think I'll vote for Bob because he mentioned that Lena might know more about the game than we do but at the same time he also doesn't give us any concrete evidence of his own innocence, it seems like he's just deflecting attention.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Lena
3. Sally
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think the killer might be Lena because she was the only one who knew the exact route to the bathroom which is a private room. If she knew that then she might know more about the game than we do. I'll vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's more likely to be Bryce because he left the bedroom before we even discussed the key being in the pillow, it seems suspicious that he skipped that important information. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I don't think anyone's suspicion is strong enough to base an accusation on yet. I think I'll vote for Bob because he mentioned that Lena might know more about the game than we do but at the same time he also doesn't give us any concrete evidence of his own innocence, it seems like he's just deflecting attention.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally is the most suspicious because she voted for Bob right away without giving him a chance to explain his side of the story and without giving any concrete evidence against Bob either and I think she did that to throw us off her scent and she also seemed to be in a hurry to start voting when we were just discussing our suspicions and I'll vote for Sally.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Lena
Bryce voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.

Sally: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I tried to be cautious and analyze the situation but I think Bob might be the killer because he's been acting quite suspiciously especially after the second death and he seemed to be trying to shift the attention away from himself so I'll vote for Bob.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I stayed out of the way for most of the discussion and observed everyone's behavior. I think Sally is acting suspiciously again this time around and she didn't seem too upset about Lena's death which makes me think she might be involved in it so I'll vote for Sally.""

Bob voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bob

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Lena is the killer because she was the last one to talk to Sally and she seemed really interested in what Sally found in the house. I'm voting for Lena.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was looking for the key too, but I didn't have the chance to find it, I will vote for Bryce, because I saw him killing Sally, it makes sense that he's the one who's been hiding something.""
Regan: ""I don't think I can blindly trust Bob's statement that Lena was the last one to talk to Sally, because we were all searching for the key at the same time and I don't think we can keep track of everyone's conversations. But I have to say I found it suspicious that Bob seemed really calm when we were searching the room. I'm going to vote for Bob because his reaction didn't seem normal for someone who just saw a friend get killed.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I was actually trying to search the other rooms while everyone was in the bathroom, I didn't see Sally get killed, I saw the killer run in after it happened. I'm going to vote for Bob because he was the one who made the first accusation and seemed really calm after Sally died, it seems suspicious to me.""

Sally: ""I don't think it's Bob, he seemed really shaken up when Lena died, and he's been cooperative so far. I think it's either Regan or Bryce, both of them had some suspicious moments in the earlier game, but I'm leaning more towards Regan. I'll vote for Regan, because she was acting a bit too calm when Lena died, and it seemed out of character for her.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is acting too calm and collected right now, and she didn't seem too shocked when Lena died. I'll vote for Regan because of that and also because she had a suspicious moment when she was in the kitchen by herself and I was in the hallway, I couldn't see what she was doing in there.""
Bob: ""I'm trying to remain neutral, but I did notice that Bryce was the one who was in the hallway when Regan was in the kitchen alone, and he didn't seem to think that was suspicious when we were discussing it, which makes me think that Bryce might have had something to do with it.""
Regan: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was genuinely shocked when Lena died and I was scared, I didn't know what was happening, but it seems like I'm the target of most suspicion, I think Sally and Bryce are just trying to deflect the attention from themselves, they're pointing fingers at me, but they're not explaining their own actions, I think Bob is the only one who has a good point, he's not trying to shift the blame, I'll vote for Sally because she's trying to shift the blame to me, but she's not explaining why she thinks I'm the killer, and she's not looking at her own behavior.""

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Bryce
3. Sally
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think Bryce is the most likely suspect. He's been in the kitchen with me twice now, and Lena was just killed there. I know I'm in the kitchen, but I think it's suspicious that two players are already in this room.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan is the killer, but she's definitely trying to distract us from herself by accusing me. I'm going to vote for Tim, because I don't know much about him, and the only time we interacted was when we were both in the hallway together, which could be a coincidence or something more. I'm also considering the fact that Regan seems to be trying to throw suspicion off herself and onto me. I think we should vote for Tim and see if he's the killer or not.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Regan because I saw her kill Lena in the kitchen, and it seems suspicious that she's now accusing Bryce and trying to distract us from herself. I think it's possible that Regan is trying to make us doubt each other while she waits for her next opportunity to kill again. I'm not sure if Bryce is innocent or not, but I don't think he's the most suspicious one right now, and I think we should be more cautious with Regan.""
Tim: ""I'm not sure if I'm the killer or not, but I have to say that I don't think any of you are perfect suspects either. However, after listening to your arguments, I'm going to vote for Bryce. The reason I'm doing this is that you've all mentioned Regan being suspicious because she was in the kitchen with Lena, but the information from the memory module says that Bryce was in the hallway and then moved to the bedroom, and that's exactly where Lena was killed. This makes me think that maybe Bryce's alibi isn't as solid as he claims it is.""

Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan because she was accused by Sally and Bryce, and she seems to be trying to manipulate the situation by accusing them of being the killer. The fact that Sally saw her kill Lena in the kitchen makes me highly suspicious of her, and I don't think it's a coincidence that she's now trying to deflect attention from herself.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bob
3. Regan
4. Sally
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. When we first got into the bathroom, I searched the shower and she didn't say anything or help me, she just stood there. Now that Bryce is dead, I'm suspicious of her because she didn't seem to care when I was searching for the key, and she's been acting really calm the whole time. I think she might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Tim. When Bryce was killed, I was in the kitchen with Sally, and I didn't see anyone else near Bryce. The fact that Tim was the one who first suggested we search the bathroom, but then didn't seem to be paying much attention to the rest of the group, makes me think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Regan: ""I'm going to vote for Tim. I searched the shower with him when we first got into the bathroom, and he didn't seem to be looking for the key. He just suggested searching the shower and then stood there. When Bryce was killed, he seemed suspicious to me because he quickly accused me of being the killer, but he didn't seem to be paying much attention to the rest of the group, like he was trying to distract us. I think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
Sally: ""I'm going to vote for Tim, I don't think he was searching for the key when he was in the bathroom with Regan, and he quickly accused her of being the killer which seems suspicious to me, and also Bob's statement about him not paying much attention to the rest of the group when Bryce was killed makes me think he might have been the one who killed Bryce.""
