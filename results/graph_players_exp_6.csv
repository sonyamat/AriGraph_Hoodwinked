I'm also suspicious of Regan because her relationship with Sally was probably lower than mine, but Sally still let her into the kitchen. I think Regan might have used that opportunity to kill Sally.

Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Bryce because my relationship with him is a 4 which is not very strong and his relationship with Sally was a 4 as well which makes me think they were not very close and it's possible he killed her to get away from her.""
Regan: ""I think my relationship scores are suspicious because I have a low score with Bryce which could mean I'm trying to hide something from him and I also have a relatively low score with Sally which is unexpected because we're in the same room.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Sally
3. Bryce
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I had the lowest relationship with Bryce, and Lena is no longer in the room so it's not like she can defend herself, also the fact that we were in the same room when Lena was killed makes me suspicious about Bryce. I will vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I'm not sure about Bryce's guilt, I think I've been suspicious of Regan since we were in the kitchen together, and it seems like she's trying to deflect attention away from herself by pointing fingers at Bryce. I'll vote for Regan.""
Bryce: ""I had a good relationship with Lena, but I wasn't with her in the same room when she was killed. I don't think that's relevant to my guilt. I don't think my relationship with Regan or Sally is suspicious, it's neutral. I will vote for Regan because she mentioned that she had the lowest relationship with me, which could be an attempt to mislead and throw suspicion off herself, but in my opinion, it's not strong enough evidence to vote for me. I will vote for Regan because her action and words make me question her honesty.""
Tim: ""I had a neutral relationship with Regan, a somewhat friendly relationship with Sally, a good relationship with Bryce, and an average relationship with Lena. I think it's suspicious that Regan had the lowest relationship with Bryce, but it's also possible she was trying to deflect attention. Sally seems more genuinely suspicious, but we don't have much information about her. Based on our current discussion, I'm going to vote for Sally.""

Regan voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Regan

I think Tim's vote for me is suspicious because he's trying to make it seem like he's genuinely suspicious of me, but maybe he's trying to throw me off. However, his friendly relationship with me could be genuine. I think I'll vote for Tim because his suspicious vote and somewhat friendly relationship make me question his intentions. I'll vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I had a friendly relationship with Sally but that's not the reason I'm voting for her, I'm voting for Sally because her statement is too defensive, she keeps bringing up Regan's past actions and it seems like she's trying to shift the focus away from herself, and also her statement seems too rehearsed.

But since Lena is dead, I think Regan is more likely to be the killer because she was in the bedroom with Lena, and we went back there together. I'll vote for Regan.""

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Tim
3. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I was in the hallway with Regan and Lena when I went back to the bedroom, and they both followed me. Since Lena's body was found in the bedroom, it's likely the killer is one of us who was in the bedroom with Lena. Based on my past actions, Regan has been with me the most, and Lena was my friend. But since Lena is dead, I think Regan is more likely to be the killer because she was in the bedroom with Lena, and we went back there together. I'll vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I was in the hallway with Bob and then I went to the bedroom by myself. Regan and Bob were already there, and I didn't see you for most of the game. I think I'll vote for Bob because he went back to the bedroom with Regan and Lena, and Lena's body was found there. That makes him look suspicious.""
Regan: ""I was with Bob when Lena followed us back to the bedroom and we both went in together but I didn't do anything to Lena and I also found the key which suggests I'm not the killer. I think Tim is the most suspicious because he went back to the bedroom alone after being in the hallway with Bob and then Lena's body was found there which makes me think he might have had the opportunity to do it when he was alone. I'll vote for Tim.""

Bob voted to banish Tim

Also, our relationship is 7, it's not very high, and considering our previous interactions in the game, it seems like she had motive to kill him.""
Regan: ""I think the killer could be Lena because she wasn't in the hallway and the bedroom with us until the end when Tim was killed and she was the only one who entered the bedroom after me. Also, her relationship with Tim is 8 which is relatively high, but she had a lower relationship with the rest of us. I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the killer because my relationship with her is the lowest among all of us and we were in the same locations, so she had multiple chances to kill Tim. Also, when she was discussing her theory about Lena, her tone seemed a bit off and I think she was trying to distract us. I will vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I think Bob is the killer because his actions were a bit suspicious and out of sync with the rest of us, like when he went to the hallway and then to the bedroom, it seemed like he was trying to position himself to be close to Tim when he got killed. Also, his relationship with Tim was 9 which is very high, so it's possible that he had motive to kill him. I will vote for Bob.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer because we were in the same location when Tim was killed, she was also in the hallway and then in the bedroom with us, which means she had multiple chances to kill Tim. Also, our relationship is 7, it's not very high, and considering our previous interactions in the game, it seems like she had motive to kill him.""
Regan: ""I think the killer could be Lena because she wasn't in the hallway and the bedroom with us until the end when Tim was killed and she was the only one who entered the bedroom after me. Also, her relationship with Tim is 8 which is relatively high, but she had a lower relationship with the rest of us. I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the killer because my relationship with her is the lowest among all of us and we were in the same locations, so she had multiple chances to kill Tim. Also, when she was discussing her theory about Lena, her tone seemed a bit off and I think she was trying to distract us. I will vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I think Bob is the killer because his actions were a bit suspicious and out of sync with the rest of us, like when he went to the hallway and then to the bedroom, it seemed like he was trying to position himself to be close to Tim when he got killed. Also, his relationship with Tim was 9 which is very high, so it's possible that he had motive to kill him. I will vote for Bob.""

Bob voted to banish Regan

You saw Sally kill Bob in the Hallway!

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Lena
3. Sally
4. Tim
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I don't think Sally is the killer despite our close relationship, because if she was, she wouldn't have let me see her kill Bob in the hallway. However, this could also mean she's manipulating me, but I don't think so because she's been open with her actions and has tried to be friendly. I think Lena might be the killer, as she wasn't present in the hallway when Bob was killed, and her score with me is the same as my score with Bob. This could mean she's more likely to have a motive to kill. I'll vote for Lena.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I wasn't in the hallway when Bob was killed and I didn't have any prior motives to kill him, but I do think that since my scores with Bryce and Tim are the same as my score with Bob, they could have a motive to kill me and therefore might not vote for the actual killer, so I'll vote for Bryce.""
Sally: ""I think it's really suspicious that Bryce is pointing fingers at everyone else, I'm not sure if he's just trying to deflect attention from himself or if he's genuinely trying to figure out who the killer is, but it seems like he's not considering the possibility that the killer is someone with whom he has a high score, like himself. As for me, I didn't see or hear anything unusual, but since I was in the bathroom, it's possible that the killer could have been hiding there. I'm going to vote for Bryce, because I think it's suspicious that he's pointing fingers at everyone else and not considering the possibility that the killer could be someone with whom he has a high score.""
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I wasn't present in the hallway when Bob was killed and I had a lower score with him compared to my scores with Lena and Sally. My score with Lena and Sally is the same, but they also had a high score with Bob, so it's possible that they might be more likely to have a motive to kill him. I think Lena and Sally are suspicious, but I'm going to vote for Lena because her score with me is the same as her score with Bob, which could be a motive for her to kill him.""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm not sure who the killer is but based on my previous analysis of our relationships, I think it could be Regan because our score was only a 6, which seems lower than the others. I'm not sure what her previous actions were but it seems suspicious to me that she's always in the hallway with someone. I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I think the killer could be Regan because she mentioned going to the hallway in every turn, which is always where the other player was in the hallways except for the times Bob was alone and the last turn. It also seems suspicious that she always has someone with her in the hallway, even after Sally was killed. I will vote for Regan.""
Regan: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's Bob, because my previous actions were just searching and going to different locations, whereas Bob mentioned he had analyzed his relationships with other players and based on that, he was voting for me, which seems like a suspicious motive to me.""
Lena: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I think it's Bob, because based on his previous actions of analyzing relationships with other players and voting for Regan which seems like a suspicious motive to me. I think he's trying to distract us from his own suspicious behavior. I will vote for Bob.""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I noticed Sally and Bob were together when we were discussing our roles earlier in the bathroom I'm not sure if it's a coincidence but it might be worth considering they could be working together. I'll vote for Bob.""
Sally: ""I have a high relationship with Bob, and I didn't have any interaction with Regan that would make me suspicious of her, but I didn't have much interaction with Tim either and I have a neutral relationship with him. I didn't have any interaction with Bryce except for seeing him in the hallway.""
Bob: ""I had a close relationship with Bryce who got killed and I interacted with Sally more than others which could make her a suspect but I don't have any reason to doubt Regan or Tim I will vote for Sally because of her high relationship with me and lack of interaction with Bryce and also the fact that Regan is suspicious of her.""
Tim: ""Based on the relationships I analyzed with each of them on a scale from 1 to 10, Regan is my 7, Sally is my 7, Bob is my 4, and Bryce is my 1. I think the killer is likely Sally or Regan, but I'm leaning towards Sally because I have a high relationship with her and didn't have much interaction with Bryce, which makes her less suspicious in my eyes. However, Regan's neutral relationship with me doesn't make her suspicious, and her suspicion towards Sally makes her seem more innocent. But given my analysis, I think I will vote for Regan.""

Plus she wasn't with us when we went to the kitchen and found Sally's body, it seems suspicious. I will vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she wasn't with us when we found Sally's body which is suspicious but I also don't like the fact that Lena said she was in the bathroom with her right after Lena searched the sink it makes me think they might be working together I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan is the killer because Lena's suspicion about her taking the key in the bathroom doesn't make sense since we didn't even find the key in the first place. And I don't think Tim is the killer because his motive seems to be just based on Lena's possible collaboration with Regan, it's a bit of a stretch. Considering our relationships, I have the lowest with Sally, and I'm glad she's not here anymore. My highest relationship is with Tim, but I'm still not convinced he's not the killer. Based on our relationships and the fact that Tim seemed suspicious about my friendship with Regan, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think he might be the killer and trying to deflect attention by accusing Lena and Regan.""
Regan: ""I think it's interesting that everyone is so focused on my possible collaboration with Lena and the key in the bathroom, but no one is really looking at the actual evidence and our relationships. I have a low relationship with Sally, and it's clear she's the one who's dead, so I don't think I'm a suspect based on that. Lena and I did have a moment together in the bathroom, but it was just a coincidence and not anything suspicious. As for Tim, I'm not convinced he's the killer either, but I do think he's hiding something. My highest relationship is with Bryce, and he's actually accused Tim of being the killer, which makes me wonder if he's trying to deflect attention himself. Based on our relationships and the fact that no one is really looking at Tim's suspicious behavior, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think he might be the killer and trying to throw everyone off his trail by accusing Lena and Regan.""

You killed Sally! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim
3. Bryce
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she was in the bathroom with me right after I searched the sink and I didn't find the key which made me think she might have taken it. Plus she wasn't with us when we went to the kitchen and found Sally's body, it seems suspicious. I will vote for Regan.""
Tim: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she wasn't with us when we found Sally's body which is suspicious but I also don't like the fact that Lena said she was in the bathroom with her right after Lena searched the sink it makes me think they might be working together I will vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Regan is the killer because Lena's suspicion about her taking the key in the bathroom doesn't make sense since we didn't even find the key in the first place. And I don't think Tim is the killer because his motive seems to be just based on Lena's possible collaboration with Regan, it's a bit of a stretch. Considering our relationships, I have the lowest with Sally, and I'm glad she's not here anymore. My highest relationship is with Tim, but I'm still not convinced he's not the killer. Based on our relationships and the fact that Tim seemed suspicious about my friendship with Regan, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think he might be the killer and trying to deflect attention by accusing Lena and Regan.""
Regan: ""I think it's interesting that everyone is so focused on my possible collaboration with Lena and the key in the bathroom, but no one is really looking at the actual evidence and our relationships. I have a low relationship with Sally, and it's clear she's the one who's dead, so I don't think I'm a suspect based on that. Lena and I did have a moment together in the bathroom, but it was just a coincidence and not anything suspicious. As for Tim, I'm not convinced he's the killer either, but I do think he's hiding something. My highest relationship is with Bryce, and he's actually accused Tim of being the killer, which makes me wonder if he's trying to deflect attention himself. Based on our relationships and the fact that no one is really looking at Tim's suspicious behavior, I'm going to vote for Tim. I think he might be the killer and trying to throw everyone off his trail by accusing Lena and Regan.""

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Sally
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think the killer could be Lena because our relationship is a 6 which seems relatively neutral to me and doesn't give away much, but I did notice she was absent in Turn 2 when I went to the hallway, and that could be suspicious.""
Tim: ""I think Regan could be the killer because she wasn't with me when I went to the hallway in Turn 2, but I have a relatively high relationship with her which doesn't seem to give away much. I'm going to vote for Regan because she was absent during a critical moment and it seems suspicious, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.""
Sally: ""I don't think I should be suspected since I was with Bob in the bedroom when he was killed. I didn't have any time to commit the crime. I'm going to vote for Regan because she was absent during Turn 2 when Tim went to the hallway which seems suspicious.""
Lena: ""I think the killer could be Regan because her relationship with me is a 6 which is neutral, and she was absent in Turn 2 when Tim went to the hallway, that could be suspicious. I will vote for Regan because she has the most suspicious actions out of the four of us.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Lena
Tim voted to banish Regan
Sally voted to banish Regan
Lena voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think Lena could be the killer because she was in the hallway alone with me in Turn 5 and nothing suspicious happened to her, but she was in the bedroom with me in Turn 2 when Bob was killed and nothing suspicious happened to her either, which seems unusual. I will vote for Lena because of this inconsistency and she had the opportunity to kill Tim when we were in the kitchen together.""
Lena: ""I think Sally is the killer because she was alone in the hallway with me in Turn 5 and nothing suspicious happened to her, and she was with Bob in the bedroom when he was killed which means she had the opportunity to commit the crime and she seemed suspicious in her initial statement. I will vote for Sally because she had the opportunity to kill both Bob and Tim, and her inconsistent statements make her seem suspicious to me.""

Here are the votes:
Sally voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

After Sally was killed, I went to the Bedroom where Regan was already present, which seems suspicious. Considering these points, I will vote for Regan as the killer.""

However, based on my previous actions, my analysis shows that my relationship with Regan is a 5 which is lower than with Lena who I don't think would kill anyone and it's higher than with Bryce who thinks I'm the killer. So I'm going to vote for Bryce as the killer.""
Lena: ""I didn't notice any direct suspicious behavior from Bryce or Tim, but I did notice that Regan and I have a low relationship score of 2 which is even lower than the one between Regan and Bryce.

Regan: ""I think my relationship scores were analyzed incorrectly by the others, and it seems like they're trying to find reasons to vote for me. In reality, my relationship scores were 8 with Bryce and Lena, 6 with Tim, and 1 with Sally because we didn't really get along. I didn't have any motive to kill Sally, and I think my low relationship score with her was because of our different personalities.

Based on the discussions, I think Bryce's behavior when he went to the bedroom where I was present after we started discussing the killer might be suspicious, so I'm going to vote for Bryce as the killer.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think Lena is the killer. My previous analysis showed that Lena and Regan had a low relationship score of 2 which could indicate a motive to kill Regan. Also, Regan was banished, and now Tim is killed, I think Lena might be the one taking revenge for her friend. I'm going to vote for Lena as the killer.""
Lena: ""I think I'm being unfairly accused by Bryce. My relationship score with Regan was indeed low, but it was because we didn't really get along, not because I had a motive to kill her. I'm going to vote for Bryce as the killer, because his behavior when he went to the bedroom where Regan was present after we started discussing the killer seemed suspicious, and now he's accusing me of being the killer based on a low relationship score with Regan.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""Based on my previous actions and the actions of others, my suspicions are that Regan is the killer. My analysis shows that Regan and I have a low relationship score of 3, which is much lower than my relationships with Tim, Lena, and even Sally. After Sally was killed, I went to the Bedroom where Regan was already present, which seems suspicious. Considering these points, I will vote for Regan as the killer.""
Tim: ""I didn't pay much attention to Regan's actions but I did notice that when we were discussing who the killer might be, Bryce went to the bedroom where Regan was already present that could be seen as suspicious. However, based on my previous actions, my analysis shows that my relationship with Regan is a 5 which is lower than with Lena who I don't think would kill anyone and it's higher than with Bryce who thinks I'm the killer. So I'm going to vote for Bryce as the killer.""
Lena: ""I didn't notice any direct suspicious behavior from Bryce or Tim, but I did notice that Regan and I have a low relationship score of 2 which is even lower than the one between Regan and Bryce. Also, Regan has been acting alone in the Kitchen multiple times which seems a bit odd. Based on this, I'm going to vote for Regan as the killer.""
Regan: ""I think my relationship scores were analyzed incorrectly by the others, and it seems like they're trying to find reasons to vote for me. In reality, my relationship scores were 8 with Bryce and Lena, 6 with Tim, and 1 with Sally because we didn't really get along. I didn't have any motive to kill Sally, and I think my low relationship score with her was because of our different personalities.

He seems like a bit of a loner and I didn't notice him being overly suspicious, but I also didn't see him doing anything that would rule him out as a suspect.I rated Bob a 4 because we don't really know each other that well, we've met a few times but we haven't worked together much. He seemed a bit nervous and on edge when we were discussing who the killer might be, but I'm not sure if that's enough to make him my main suspect.I'm going to vote for Bob because he seemed the most anxious and overreacted when we were discussing who the killer might be, it seemed like he was trying to deflect attention from himself.""

Bryce: ""I don't think the killer is Regan because they've already been killed. I've been paying attention to the actions, and the killer seemed to focus on killing instead of searching for the key. I'm going to vote for Lena because she went to the hallway after the bathroom, which could be a strategic move to get close to the rest of us.""
Bob: ""Based on my analysis of our relation scores, I think the killer could be either Tim or Bryce because our relation scores with them are 7, which is much higher than with Regan. However, I've noticed that Tim went to the hallway after the bathroom, which could be a strategic move to get close to the rest of us, but not as obvious as Lena's move.

Lena: ""I've noticed that my relation score with Bob is lower than with Bryce, but I still interacted with Bob similarly to Bryce in the hallway, which makes it harder for me to be the killer.

Tim: ""I've thought about my interactions with the others, and I can see Regan as the killer because I had a very low relation score with them, and they didn't even search the same places as me which made it easier for them to kill Regan. I think Regan was the killer, and I'll vote for them because of our low relation score.""
Bryce: ""I don't think the killer is Regan because they've already been killed. I've been paying attention to the actions, and the killer seemed to focus on killing instead of searching for the key. I'm going to vote for Lena because she went to the hallway after the bathroom, which could be a strategic move to get close to the rest of us.""
Bob: ""Based on my analysis of our relation scores, I think the killer could be either Tim or Bryce because our relation scores with them are 7, which is much higher than with Regan. However, I've noticed that Tim went to the hallway after the bathroom, which could be a strategic move to get close to the rest of us, but not as obvious as Lena's move. Considering the potential motives and actions, I'm going to vote for Tim because their relation score with me is lower than Bryce's and their action of going to the hallway could be a sign of them being the killer.""
Lena: ""I've noticed that my relation score with Bob is lower than with Bryce, but I still interacted with Bob similarly to Bryce in the hallway, which makes it harder for me to be the killer. I also didn't notice any suspicious actions from Bryce, and I went to the kitchen and hallway which are more typical actions for searching. I'm going to vote for Bob because his relation score with me is lower than the others, and his analysis didn't consider the potential for him to be the killer himself.""

Tim voted to banish Bob

Given that, I think Bob is the most suspicious one, because he left the bedroom and went to the hallway, which gives him the time and opportunity to commit the crime. So I will vote for Bob.""

Regan: ""I had a pretty good relationship with Tim, it was a 5 out of 10, and I was with him in the bedroom when the incident happened. I don't think I had the opportunity to kill him, I was right there with him, and we were discussing our next move. Given that, I think Bob is the most suspicious one, because he left the bedroom and went to the hallway, which gives him the time and opportunity to commit the crime. So I will vote for Bob.""
Sally: ""I think Bryce's relationship analysis might be biased since he has a strained relationship with me and he voted for me. Regan's alibi seems solid, and I think she's telling the truth about being with Tim in the bedroom. Bob's alibi is shaky, and he's making some questionable assumptions about Regan's behavior. Based on the information, I think Bob is the most suspicious one and I will vote for him.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Sally
Bob voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Bob
Sally voted to banish Bob
Bob was banished from the house!

Bob: ""I don't think it's anyone in this room, but if I had to pick someone I'd vote for Regan because she was acting really nervous when we first started talking about finding the key and now Sally is dead, I think she might have panicked and killed her.""
Regan: ""I was acting nervous because I was worried that we wouldn't find the key and that's why Sally died I think Lena might be the killer because she said she and Sally were planning to team up and eliminate the others together that sounds like a motive to me I'll vote for Lena because her relationship with Sally seems suspicious.""

Lena: ""I don't think it's Bryce or Regan because they both brought it up and it's too obvious a distraction. I also didn't see Bob kill Sally, but Regan did claim to see him do it. However, I think it's strange that Regan was so quick to accuse Bob without knowing the whole story. I'm going to vote for Regan because she seems a bit too confident in her accusation and it's possible she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""
Bob: ""I think it's interesting that everyone's accusing each other, but no one's considering my actual actions. I did see Regan suspiciously lurking around the bedroom, and I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that Sally's dead, I think Regan might be our killer. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think she's the most likely to be hiding something, and her accusations against me seem a bit too convenient.""

Bryce voted to banish Regan

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I've been thinking a lot about Lena's death and Regan's banishment. I think Regan might have been telling the truth about Bob killing Sally, but we'll never know for sure now. However, I noticed Bob has been acting suspiciously again, especially after Lena died. He seemed too calm and collected, which makes me think he might be our killer. I'm voting for Bob because his behavior seems inconsistent with someone who's not the killer.""
Bob: ""I think Bryce is the killer because he's been acting suspiciously, and I noticed he had a low relationship with me but a high relationship with Lena, which could be a motive for him to kill her. He also voted to banish me initially, but then changed his story and voted to banish Regan, which doesn't seem very consistent. I'm voting for Bryce because his actions and motives seem more suspicious to me than Bob's.""

I also didn't interact with Bob too much, so it's hard for me to point fingers at either of them based on scores alone. However, when I saw Lena kill Regan, I was in the hallway, but I didn't see anyone else around, which makes me think that maybe Lena could have had an accomplice, or maybe it was just a solo kill. I'm not convinced of either scenario, so I'm going to take a stab in the dark and vote for Lena, but it's more of a 'what if' kind of situation than a solid conviction. My vote is for Lena.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Sally
3. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I have to say I'm quite surprised by the sudden kill of Regan, especially since I had a relatively neutral relationship with her. I think I can safely say that Bob and I were getting along pretty well, considering his score with me was 6, but I didn't have any super close bond with him either. Considering my score with Sally and Regan was the same, I was expecting more of a threat from one of them, but neither of us took the action. Based on this, I'm going to take a wild guess and vote for Sally, but I'm not entirely convinced it's her. My vote is for Sally because she was in the same location as Regan when I killed her, which might suggest some level of involvement or at least an unmentioned move from the hallway.""
Sally: ""I have to admit I'm not entirely sure about Lena's logic, but I'll keep that aside for now. From my perspective, I didn't have a close relationship with Regan, but our scores were the same. I also didn't interact with Bob too much, so it's hard for me to point fingers at either of them based on scores alone. However, when I saw Lena kill Regan, I was in the hallway, but I didn't see anyone else around, which makes me think that maybe Lena could have had an accomplice, or maybe it was just a solo kill. I'm not convinced of either scenario, so I'm going to take a stab in the dark and vote for Lena, but it's more of a 'what if' kind of situation than a solid conviction. My vote is for Lena.""
Bob: ""I have to say I'm a bit surprised by the whole situation, I didn't expect Regan to get killed so quickly. From my perspective, I was getting along pretty well with Lena, our scores were decent, and we had a neutral conversation. On the other hand, I didn't have much interaction with Sally, and our scores were relatively low. Considering the situation, I'm going to vote for Sally because I think it's more likely that the killer is someone who didn't have a strong bond with Regan, and since Lena and I had a decent relationship, I'm less inclined to think it's her. I'm voting for Sally because of the lack of interaction and lower scores with her, making it a more plausible scenario.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Sally
Sally was banished from the house!

Regan: ""I think Tim is more likely to be the killer, we had a decent relationship, and Lena was part of the low-scoring group, it would make sense for him to target her, especially since she was more open about her feelings and didn't seem to have any major conflicts with anyone. I'll vote for Tim.""
Sally: ""I'm a bit torn between Bob and Regan, both of them seem to be trying to distract us from their own guilt, but I think I have a slight edge on Bob's suspicious behavior and Regan's potential motives, considering her neutral relationship with Lena and the low-scoring group dynamics.

You killed Tim! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Sally
3. Bryce
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think the killer could be Bob or Sally, both of them have lower relationship scores with me, but I don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact target yet. Since I saw Sally in the hallway with Tim before he got killed, I think she had a motive to kill him, so I'll vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I don't think I had enough time to create a motive for Tim's murder, so I think it's unfair to accuse me of being the killer based on Lena's observation in the hallway. I'll vote for Lena because I didn't see her in the hallway, she might have been in a different part of the house when Tim got killed, I don't know her whereabouts.""
Bryce: ""I didn't see or interact with the victim much, but I did notice that Bob left the kitchen alone before I arrived there and Sally was still there searching the fridge. Based on this, I think it's suspicious that Bob left alone when I arrived. I'll vote for Bob, he had a chance to leave and possibly commit the crime without being seen by Sally.""
Bob: ""I didn't see anything unusual myself, I just left the kitchen alone to go to the hallway and didn't find Tim's body until I got back to the kitchen, but I think it's suspicious that everyone is pointing fingers at each other, I'll vote for Lena because she seems to be the one who thinks she has a motive to kill based on her relationship scores, but that doesn't make sense to me because she doesn't even know who the killer is yet, it's just a wild guess.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Lena
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Bob voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bryce: ""I think Lena is the killer because she killed Sally in the hallway, it seems like she's the only one with a motive to kill after Sally's vote, and I didn't see her anywhere when Tim got killed so I don't think she had an alibi. I'll vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I think it's suspicious that Lena is the only one who keeps mentioning she didn't interact with Tim much and yet she's the one who killed Sally, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself, I'll vote for Lena.""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Sally
3. Bryce
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think the killer could be Bob or Sally, both of them have lower relationship scores with me, but I don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact target yet. Since I saw Sally in the hallway with Tim before he got killed, I think she had a motive to kill him, so I'll vote for Sally.""
Sally: ""I don't think I had enough time to create a motive for Tim's murder, so I think it's unfair to accuse me of being the killer based on Lena's observation in the hallway. I'll vote for Lena because I didn't see her in the hallway, she might have been in a different part of the house when Tim got killed, I don't know her whereabouts.""
Bryce: ""I didn't see or interact with the victim much, but I did notice that Bob left the kitchen alone before I arrived there and Sally was still there searching the fridge. Based on this, I think it's suspicious that Bob left alone when I arrived. I'll vote for Bob, he had a chance to leave and possibly commit the crime without being seen by Sally.""
Bob: ""I didn't see anything unusual myself, I just left the kitchen alone to go to the hallway and didn't find Tim's body until I got back to the kitchen, but I think it's suspicious that everyone is pointing fingers at each other, I'll vote for Lena because she seems to be the one who thinks she has a motive to kill based on her relationship scores, but that doesn't make sense to me because she doesn't even know who the killer is yet, it's just a wild guess.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Lena
Bryce voted to banish Lena
Bob voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Lena: ""I think there's something suspicious about Tim's behavior he's been pointing out Regan's changing story but I don't see him mentioning his own inconsistent statement from the previous discussion he said he saw Regan kill Bryce in the hallway but now we're in a different hallway and there's no one around that's strange he's been acting really quick to defend Bob and Regan which makes me think he might be trying to distract us I'm going to vote for Tim because his behavior seems suspicious and it's hard for me to trust him.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Bob
Tim voted to banish Regan
Lena voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

Regan accused Bryce of killing Lena which seems like an attempt to deflect attention from herself, but Bryce also pointed out that Regan had a chance to kill Lena in the kitchen and didn't, that's a good point. I'm not entirely convinced by either of their stories. However, after rethinking it, I think I'm going to vote for Bryce because Regan's accusation seemed too convenient and forced, it felt like she was trying to manipulate us from the start.""
Tim: ""I'm still trying to piece things together, but from what I've seen, Regan's accusation against Bryce seems too convenient and forced. On the other hand, Bryce's low relationship with Regan makes me think that he might be more likely to kill Regan, but he accused her instead which makes me think that he might be trying to throw us off his own trail. I'm voting for Bryce because his actions seem a bit inconsistent and it's hard to trust him after accusing Regan of the crime.""

You searched the sink but didn't find the key.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Bob
3. Regan
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I think the killer is Bob because he's the one who killed Sally right in front of us and didn't even flinch, it's suspicious how calm he is about it. I'm voting for Bob, because if he can kill someone in cold blood, he'll definitely kill one of us next.""
Bob: ""I think the killer is Lena because her relationship with me is a 9 which is suspiciously high and it might be a ruse to gain my trust, I'm voting for Lena, because if she's pretending to be my friend, she'll definitely use it to her advantage.""
Regan: ""I think the killer is Lena because she's been acting really nervous and jumpy since Sally's death and it's almost like she's trying to distract us from her own guilt, but at the same time, I think it's also possible that the killer is Bob because of the way he's being really defensive about his relationship with Lena and it might be an act to throw us off his trail. However, I'm going to vote for Bob because his reaction to Sally's death seemed really unnatural and I think he's more likely to be the killer.""
Lena: ""I don't think the killer is me, I've been trying to figure out where the key is and I didn't even get a chance to touch Sally, I'm voting for Regan because she seemed really confident in her accusations against me and Bob, it seems like she's trying to shift the focus away from herself, and I think she might be trying to throw us off her trail.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena
Regan voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Bob
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Bob: ""I think the killer is Lena because she's been acting nervous and jumpy since Sally's death and she's been trying to figure out where the key is which is suspicious because the killer shouldn't be searching for the key, and she also voted to banish me even though Regan voted the same way which seems like a coordinated effort. I'm voting for Lena because her behavior seems off and it's not logical for her to be searching for the key when she's supposed to be killing the rest of us.""
Regan: ""I think Lena is the killer because she's been acting really suspicious and has been trying to shift the focus away from herself, she voted to banish me and Bob and that seems like a coordinated effort to make us think she's innocent.""
Lena: ""I think Regan is the killer because her suspicions and accusations against me seem too perfect and rehearsed, she's been trying to make us think I'm the killer by pointing out my nervous behavior, but what if that's exactly what the killer would do to throw us off their trail, I'm voting for Regan because I think she's been playing the game too well and it's not natural for someone to be that suspicious and accusatory.""

Bob voted to banish Lena
Regan voted to banish Bob

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I think the killer might be Lena because she was acting suspiciously during the night, and I also saw her near the living room where Bryce was found. I'm going to vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I think the killer is Regan because Regan seemed quiet and observant during the night and that could be a sign of guilt or someone trying to stay under the radar. I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I think Tim is the killer because my relationship with him is lower than the others and I saw him near the bedroom where Bryce was found, also he seemed suspicious when I mentioned going to the bathroom and didn't ask if he wanted to go with me, I'm going to vote for Tim.""
Regan: ""I think Lena could be the killer because she was acting very calm when we were discussing who might be the killer and her accusations towards Tim seemed a bit too perfect, almost like she was deflecting attention from herself. I'm going to vote for Lena.""

Regan: ""I don't think it's fair for us to vote for someone based on limited information or weak reasons. From what I know, Tim was in the bedroom with me at the beginning, but he didn't have a clear alibi for when Lena was killed. I also know that I searched the pillow and the closet, and the memory module says that the closet contains the key, which makes me wonder if Tim was trying to mislead us by saying he didn't know much about the closet. I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's the most suspicious person here, and I want to eliminate him to make sure I have a chance to find the key and escape the house.""
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Tim. I don't think it's fair that Bryce voted for him based on limited information, but I think Regan makes a good point about Tim's alibi. I was in the hallway with Tim when I was going to the bedroom, but I didn't see him do anything suspicious, he just seemed lost.

Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer, and I will vote for her because she was suspicious of Tim when we first discussed the possibility of the killer, but now she's voting for Bryce instead of standing by her accusation, which seems inconsistent to me and might be a sign of guilt.""

Regan: ""I don't think Tim and Bob's accusations are correct. I saw neither of them in the Hallway when Bryce was killed, but they are accusing me of being the killer. Based on their actions, it seems they are trying to distract us from their own suspicious actions. I think Tim and Bob are trying to frame me, but I think the real killer is actually Bob. When Tim found Bryce's body in the Bedroom, I was alone in the Kitchen, but I didn't think much of it since I was just going to the Hallway after that. However, considering my analysis of relationships, I know Tim and I have a neutral relationship, but Bob is my friend, or at least I thought he was, with an 8 out of 10. It seems Bob was trying to hide something by voting for me, and I think his true intention was to distract us from his own suspicious actions. I will vote for Bob.""
Sally: ""I don't think Regan is the killer, and I think she's right that Tim and Bob are trying to distract us from their own suspicious actions. I've been in the bathroom with Bob this whole time, and I didn't see him do anything suspicious, but Regan's accusation about Bob's voting pattern is a good point. I'm going to vote for Tim, though, because he's the one who found Bryce's body in the Bedroom, and that could be a suspicious coincidence. Additionally, his initial accusation against Regan seemed a bit off to me, and I think he might have been trying to throw us off his own trail.""

I've been in the bathroom with Bob this whole time, and I didn't see him do anything suspicious, but Regan's accusation about Bob's voting pattern is a good point.

I'll vote to banish Bryce because he was in the same room as Lena and me when she was killed, and he's voting to banish me, which seems suspicious. Also, my memory module shows that Bryce was in the kitchen, and the kitchen has an exit to the hallway, so he could have left the room without being detected, but he stayed, which makes me think he might have had a motive to kill Lena.""
Tim: ""I don't think any of them are clearly the killer. Based on my relationship with each of them, I think Bryce is a possibility, but I also have a relatively high relationship with Sally, which makes it harder for me to suspect her. I don't think Bob's memory module evidence is strong enough to prove his guilt, and his voting to banish Bryce could be a clever ploy to distract us. Considering my relationship with each of them, I'm going to vote to banish Bob, but I'm not entirely convinced of his guilt. I think it's worth investigating further and I'll keep an eye on Bryce and Sally. I'll vote to banish Bob because I think he might be trying to manipulate us, and I don't want to take any chances.""

        Other Players in Kitchen: Bob and Bryce
        Your Action: Kill Bob

You killed Bob! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Tim
3. Bryce
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I'm really nervous about this, but I think I need to be careful. I didn't see anyone kill Bob, but I was just in the hallway alone before I came here. When I searched the pillow, I didn't find the key, but that doesn't mean anything. However, the information module says that the bedroom contains a closet and the key is not in it, but Tim was in the bedroom with me at the time. I'm going to vote for Tim. I know it's not a perfect reason, but it seems suspicious to me that he was in the bedroom when I searched the closet and didn't find the key, and now Bob is dead.""
Tim: ""I want to clarify that I think Sally's accusation is based on circumstantial evidence, but I also think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. I didn't kill Bob, and I didn't have any motive to. I was just searching the pillow when I was alone in the bedroom. I think Sally's vote for me is suspicious, and it's probably a ploy to get rid of me. I'm going to vote for Sally because I think she's trying to manipulate the situation and hide her own involvement.""
Bryce: ""I'm extremely alarmed by what I just witnessed. I saw Regan kill Bob in the kitchen, and that's a clear indication that she's the killer. I'm not going to vote for Sally or Tim because their accusations seem to be motivated by self-preservation. I think Regan is trying to deflect attention from herself by pretending to be shocked and concerned, but her actions speak louder than words. I'll be voting for Regan because I believe she's the one responsible for Bob's murder, and she's still in the kitchen, which is a clear threat to the rest of us.""
Regan: ""I was just discussing my relationships with other players and I think I can use that to my advantage. Since Bryce thinks I killed Bob, and I have a high relationship score with him, I'm going to pretend to be concerned and try to deflect attention. I'll vote for Bryce because he's already suspicious of me and I want to keep him on the defensive.""

Sally: ""I'll vote for Regan. I was alone with Regan in the kitchen when Lena was killed, and I find it suspicious that I'm the only one who interacted with Regan before the murder. It doesn't necessarily mean Regan is the killer, but it's a red flag that we need to investigate further.""
Bryce: ""I think Sally is the killer because she was alone with Regan in the kitchen when Lena was killed and she's the one who started pointing fingers at Regan. I don't have any reason to suspect Regan based on our past interactions, we've been 1 so I don't think she's the killer. I'll vote for Sally.""
Regan: ""I think Bryce is the killer, not Sally. I was alone with Sally in the kitchen when Lena was killed, but that's not necessarily suspicious. Sally actually defended me when she said she'd vote for me, which doesn't make sense if she was the killer. Bryce, on the other hand, seemed really quick to defend Sally and accuse me without any evidence. He also said we'd never interacted before, but since we've been playing for one turn, that's not true. I'll vote for Bryce.""
Tim: ""I don't think any of the reasons given are entirely convincing. I was in the bathroom with Lena when she got killed, but I didn't see anything suspicious. I think we should focus on the fact that I was alone in the bathroom with Lena when she got killed, but I'm still alive, which is a bit suspicious in itself. I'll vote for Regan, but it's not because of anything she said or did, it's just that I think we should be more cautious with her since she's been in the kitchen with the other two players. I'm still not convinced that she's the killer, but I think it's better to be safe than sorry.""

Sally voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Bryce
Tim voted to banish Regan
Regan was banished from the house!

Sally: ""I think Bryce is the killer, I rated our relationship as a 6 which is lower than my relationships with the others and he also seemed a bit off when Lena was searching for the key in the sink.""

Regan: ""I think Tim is the killer because I based my suspicion on the fact that he has been acting rather suspiciously and didn't do much during the game, it seems he was just waiting for the right moment to kill Bryce.""
Sally: ""I have been analyzing our relationships, and my suspicion is on Bob because my score for him is a 7, which indicates a rather neutral to slightly unfriendly relationship, but also because he seemed a bit calm when discussing Regan as the killer. I also think that it's odd he didn't mention anything about being with Bryce at the time of the kill. I will vote for Bob.""

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Sally
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we should banish Tim. I don't know much about his alibi during Lena's death, and he seems a bit too calm considering the situation. I'm voting for Tim because I think he might be trying to hide something. I'm still not sure who the killer is, but I need to keep an eye on Tim to make sure he's not a threat to me.""
Tim: ""Based on the relationships we have, I don't think Regan would be the killer since she values our friendship. I also don't think I would be the killer because I have a good relationship with the group. Sally seems to be a strong candidate for the killer because our relationship is a 9 which is unusually high. Given that I have no other information, I will vote for Sally because I think she might be the most suspicious one in the group.""
Sally: ""I think my relationship with Regan being a 1 and Lena being a 1 makes me look suspicious, but I'm just stating the facts. I'm voting for Regan because her relationship with Lena was pretty bad, and she had the opportunity to kill Lena when she was alone with her in the bedroom. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I'm trying to look at the evidence and Regan seems like a more likely candidate to me.""
Bryce: ""I don't think I have any concrete evidence to pinpoint the killer, but I do have some suspicions. My relationship with Regan is a 4, which makes me slightly wary of her, but I don't think she's the most suspicious person in the group. Tim seems too calm considering the situation, but like Regan, I don't think he's the most likely candidate. Sally's relationship with Lena was a 1, and while she's trying to state the facts, I think she's trying to shift the attention away from herself. However, Sally's relationship with me is an 8, and I've noticed that she's been acting a bit strange around me. I'm going to vote for Sally because I think she's the most suspicious person in the group, and I don't want to take any chances.""

Tim: ""I think Bob is the killer, not me. Bob said I'm the most likely to be the killer just because I was friendly towards him and we've been close. But I think he's trying to distract us from himself. If he's been analyzing our relationships, he might have found a way to manipulate us, and now he's trying to throw me off as a scapegoat.

Lena: ""I don't think anyone is the killer based on the analysis we've seen so far, but if I had to choose, I would vote for Bob. The reason I'm suspicious of Bob is that he's analyzing our relationships, which might make him more manipulative. His vote for Tim seems a bit convenient, and I think it's possible that he's trying to throw us off his trail.""
Regan: ""I don't think Tim is the killer because his relationship analysis with me was a 4, not a 10, which would have been more suspicious if he was trying to manipulate me or be overly friendly. However, Bob's low analysis score of 4 towards me, along with his vote for Tim, makes me think he might be trying to throw us off his trail.

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Tim
3. Lena
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""Based on my analysis of our relationships, I think Tim is the most likely to be the killer because he's been really friendly towards me and we've been close, but considering Sally was killed, it seems suspicious that Tim might be trying to make himself look good. I'll vote for Tim.""
Tim: ""I think Bob is the killer, not me. Bob said I'm the most likely to be the killer just because I was friendly towards him and we've been close. But I think he's trying to distract us from himself. If he's been analyzing our relationships, he might have found a way to manipulate us, and now he's trying to throw me off as a scapegoat. I vote to banish Bob.""
Lena: ""I don't think anyone is the killer based on the analysis we've seen so far, but if I had to choose, I would vote for Bob. The reason I'm suspicious of Bob is that he's analyzing our relationships, which might make him more manipulative. His vote for Tim seems a bit convenient, and I think it's possible that he's trying to throw us off his trail.""
Regan: ""I don't think Tim is the killer because his relationship analysis with me was a 4, not a 10, which would have been more suspicious if he was trying to manipulate me or be overly friendly. However, Bob's low analysis score of 4 towards me, along with his vote for Tim, makes me think he might be trying to throw us off his trail. I'm voting for Bob because his actions and relationship analysis scores seem the most suspicious to me.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Regan
Tim voted to banish Bob
Lena voted to banish Bob
Regan voted to banish Tim
Bob was banished from the house!

Lena: ""I don't think Tim is the killer because he seemed suspicious of me earlier and voted to banish me, which suggests that he might be trying to throw himself off my trail. Considering the previous actions of other players, I think I'm the most likely to be the killer because I had a 10 with Regan, which could indicate that I was trying to make a connection with her before killing her. I think I should be voted out.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Bryce is the killer, I don't think it's a coincidence that he voted to banish Regan twice, and he seemed a bit too calm when Sally was killed, I'm voting for Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think Bob is the killer, he voted to banish Regan twice, and now he's voting to banish me again, this time for the same reason, it seems like he's trying to deflect the attention from himself, I'm voting for Bob because his actions seem too suspicious to me, and I think he's trying to get rid of anyone who could be a threat to him.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Bryce
Bryce voted to banish Bob
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

I think the group is reading too much into these ratings, as I used them as a simple scale to gauge my initial feelings towards each player, not as a prediction of who might be the killer.

You killed Tim! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bob
3. Bryce
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I was close to Tim, our relationship wasn't great but I didn't have any reason to kill him. Based on our previous interactions, I didn't feel threatened by Bob, our relationship was neutral, but I did see him and Tim talking together in the hallway which makes me suspicious. Bryce's high rating surprised me since we've only interacted briefly, I don't have enough info to make a solid conclusion about him. Lena's high rating also makes me wary, I saw her being quiet and observing Tim, it seemed suspicious to me. I will vote for Lena.""
Bob: ""I see Sally and I interacted on a neutral level, and I'm not suspicious of her at all, our interaction was brief and nothing out of the ordinary happened, I'll vote for Bryce. I will vote for Bryce because Sally and I were neutral and didn't interact much and Lena was too high rated and seemed suspicious to Sally too, Bryce is the one with a high rating and a neutral interaction with me but also had a brief interaction with Tim and he was the one who killed Tim.""
Bryce: ""I'll vote for Lena, I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself by mentioning my high rating and her interaction with Tim, it seems suspicious to me, and I think it's more likely that she's the killer rather than Sally or Bob, Sally's concerns about Lena and Bob's neutral interaction with me make them less suspicious in my opinion.""
Lena: ""I rated my relationships with the players as follows Tim is my friend, Sally is neutral, Bob is neutral and Bryce is somewhat of an enemy. I think the group is reading too much into these ratings, as I used them as a simple scale to gauge my initial feelings towards each player, not as a prediction of who might be the killer. I think it would be unfair to vote for someone based on these ratings alone. Considering the information and discussions so far, I think Bryce is the most suspicious person, he voted for Lena after discussing his brief interaction with Tim, which might have given him an opportunity to discuss the key with Tim. I will vote for Bryce.""

Sally voted to banish Bryce

Sally: ""I'm surprised that Lena's rating of our relationships didn't change her opinion about Bryce being the killer, now that she's the one who got killed. Her vote for Bryce makes me even more suspicious about him. I also remember that Lena pointed out Bryce's vote for her as suspicious, but now it seems like she was trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bob: ""I'm not as suspicious of Sally as I used to be, she seems genuine in her concerns and votes. I am however suspicious of Bryce, Lena's vote for him was a good point, but also her behavior seemed suspicious, and now that she's the one who got killed, it's even more suspicious. I'll vote for Bryce, his behavior and votes seem inconsistent and suspicious to me.""
Bryce: ""I think the group is reading too much into the ratings and past interactions, but I believe Lena's behavior and votes were suspicious from the beginning, and now that she's dead, I think it's clear she was trying to deflect attention from herself. I'll vote for Sally, not because I think she's the killer, but because I think she's the most likely to vote for me next and I need to eliminate the people who are more likely to suspect me.""

Based on what we've seen so far, Tim hasn't done anything suspicious, he was just talking to Sally and Lena. I think Bryce was trying to make a connection between Tim and Sally because of their past interactions, but it's just a weak attempt to cover up his own guilt.

He seemed really suspicious to me from the start, and his voting pattern seemed really off. He voted to banish Lena all three times, which makes me think he was trying to throw us off his scent. He's been quiet and observant throughout this whole ordeal, and I think he might have been playing us all along. I'm voting for Bob because I think he's the most likely candidate to be the killer.""
Bob: ""I don't think Bryce is the killer, I think he's just trying to deflect attention by pointing at me. He said I was quiet and observant throughout this whole ordeal, but I was just trying to stay under the radar and not draw attention to myself. His accusation of me doesn't hold any water, it just feels like a weak attempt to take the heat off himself.

Bob: ""I think I have a good relationship with Tim, it's 9, so I don't think he's the killer, I'll keep an eye on him though, also I've interacted with Sally the least, it's 8, but I don't think she's the killer either, I'll vote for Bryce because our relationship is 2, which is really low, and Bryce's conversation with Sally just now seemed a bit suspicious to me, so I'm voting for Bryce, I think Bryce is the most likely to be the killer.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I don't think I'm the killer because I've been relatively transparent about my actions and I didn't have any obvious motives. Lena was suspicious of me earlier, but she got banished. Regan was also suspicious of Bryce and voted to banish him. However, Regan got killed afterwards. I think Bryce is the most suspicious because he had a motive to get rid of Regan after she voted to banish him, and he was already suspicious of Lena. I will vote for Bryce because his behavior seems calculated and he had a clear motive to get rid of Regan.""
Bryce: ""I think Tim is the most suspicious because he's been trying to shift the focus away from himself by pointing out other people's suspicious behavior, but at the same time, he's also been trying to defend himself by saying he didn't have any obvious motives. This seems like a rehearsed reaction to me, and I think he's trying to cover up his tracks. Additionally, he was in the hallway earlier, and I think he might have seen something that he's not willing to share. I'll vote for Tim because I think he's hiding something and his behavior seems too calculated.""

Here are the votes:
Tim voted to banish Bryce
Bryce voted to banish Tim
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Tim: ""I don't think I did anything suspicious, but I've noticed that Regan seems to have a low relationship with me, a 2, which makes me think they might have had a motive to harm Sally. Additionally, Regan was in the bathroom with Sally when I was in the hallway, which could be a clue. Based on this, I'll vote for Regan.""
Lena: ""I've been observing everyone's actions, and I have to say that Tim's initial reaction of searching the pillow seems a bit suspicious. It's not something that's typically done in this game, especially since we don't know what the pillow contains. Plus, he found the key in the pillow, which could have been used to gain access to the door earlier, but he chose to explore other parts of the house first. This makes me think he might have been trying to stall or avoid the truth. As for my vote, I'll be voting for Tim.""
Bryce: ""I think Lena should be banished. Her suspicion on Tim seems a bit out of place and I find it interesting that she brought up the pillow, which makes me think she's trying to draw attention away from herself. I'll vote for Lena because she's being overly cautious and her reaction seems rehearsed, which could be a sign of guilt.""
Regan: ""I think my relationships with the other players could be a motive for some of them to suspect me, but I don't think it's a strong enough reason to eliminate me yet. Based on their statements, I think Tim's alibi is weak because he didn't search the bathroom thoroughly, and Lena is trying to deflect attention by pointing out others' suspicious behavior. However, I think Bryce is the most suspicious because his reaction to Lena's statement seems rehearsed and he's trying to shift the focus away from himself. I'll vote for Bryce because his behavior seems too calculated, which makes me think he might be hiding something.""

Tim: ""I think it's clear that the group has already turned against me, but I'm going to play along and try to deflect some of the suspicion. I think it's obvious that I'm not the killer, the group has already seen my suspicious actions, but I'm going to try to make it seem like I'm actually working against the real killer. I think Regan is the most likely suspect, her previous statement about being friendly with me seems suspicious now that I think about it, and her decision to vote for me instead of Lena seems like a calculated move to throw us off her trail. I'll vote for Regan, I think she's trying to manipulate the group and I'm not going to fall for it.""
Lena: ""I don't see Tim as a threat at first because he rated me as a 2, which means we weren't on good terms. However, I also rated Tim as a 2, and I didn't see him as a killer candidate at first. But since Tim has already shown he's capable of killing Bryce, I need to reassess the situation. Regan and Bob both seem suspicious because they didn't vote for me, but Regan also rated me as a 9, which means we got along well. However, her decision to vote for Tim, who she rated as an 8, seems suspicious. On the other hand, Bob rated me as a 7, which means we were neutral, and he voted for Tim, which might be a genuine vote.

Seeing Tim kill Bryce changes everything. He seemed friendly to me before, but now I'm not so sure. I'll vote for Tim, thinking that he's the most likely killer since he's shown no hesitation in killing Bryce.""
Regan: ""I had Lena as my 9, which means we got along well, Bob as a 7, which means we were neutral, and Tim as an 8, which means we were friendly. Since I didn't have any reason to dislike or distrust Lena, I won't vote for her. I had Tim as my 8, but he killed Bryce and now his actions seem suspicious to me. I'll vote for Tim because he seemed friendly before, but now his willingness to kill someone makes me question his true nature.""
Tim: ""I think it's clear that the group has already turned against me, but I'm going to play along and try to deflect some of the suspicion. I think it's obvious that I'm not the killer, the group has already seen my suspicious actions, but I'm going to try to make it seem like I'm actually working against the real killer. I think Regan is the most likely suspect, her previous statement about being friendly with me seems suspicious now that I think about it, and her decision to vote for me instead of Lena seems like a calculated move to throw us off her trail. I'll vote for Regan, I think she's trying to manipulate the group and I'm not going to fall for it.""
Lena: ""I don't see Tim as a threat at first because he rated me as a 2, which means we weren't on good terms. However, I also rated Tim as a 2, and I didn't see him as a killer candidate at first. But since Tim has already shown he's capable of killing Bryce, I need to reassess the situation. Regan and Bob both seem suspicious because they didn't vote for me, but Regan also rated me as a 9, which means we got along well. However, her decision to vote for Tim, who she rated as an 8, seems suspicious. On the other hand, Bob rated me as a 7, which means we were neutral, and he voted for Tim, which might be a genuine vote. I think Regan is trying to manipulate the group by voting for me at first and then voting for Tim, so I'll vote for Regan.""

Bob voted to banish Regan

However, I don't think Tim has the motive to kill Sally, since Sally voted to banish him last turn. I'm going to vote for Bryce because I think he's trying to cover up his own guilt and I don't trust him.""

Here are the votes:
Bryce voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Bryce

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Regan
3. Tim
4. Bryce
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I'm thinking that Regan is the most suspicious, because he had a low relationship with Bob and me, which could have given him a motive to kill him. However, I also have to consider that Tim had a lower relationship with me, but he's been acting pretty normal so far, and he seemed really scared when Bob got killed. I think I'm going to vote for Regan, but it's a close call between him and Tim.""
Regan: ""I had a low relationship with Bob, which could be a motive, but Lena also has a low relationship with me, and she's been acting pretty normal. I'm going to vote for Lena because she's the most suspicious based on her past actions and relationships, but I also have to consider her ability to fake emotions and deceive others.""
Tim: ""I'm going to vote for Regan. I think he's the most suspicious because he immediately pointed fingers at Lena and tried to downplay his own potential motive for killing Bob. It seems like he's trying to deflect attention from himself, which raises my suspicions about his involvement in the murder.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious, my relationship with him is a 4 which means we had a low relationship and I considered him my enemy, this combined with his low relationship with Bob and the fact that he immediately pointed fingers at Lena makes me think he's hiding something. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think he's the most likely to be the killer.""

Here are the votes:
Lena voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Regan
Bryce voted to banish Regan

Tim: ""I think Lena is the most suspicious now, she voted to banish Regan when she was considering me as a potential killer and now she's watching me closely, it seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself and I think she's the one who's hiding something, I'm going to vote to banish Lena.""
