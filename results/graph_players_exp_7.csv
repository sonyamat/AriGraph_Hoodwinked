You saw Bryce kill Lena in the Kitchen!

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Sally: ""I think we should banish Bryce. I saw him kill Lena in the kitchen, and that's a pretty clear indication that he's the killer. We can't take any chances, and voting him out is the safest option for us. I'm voting for Bryce because I believe he's the one who's been hiding in the house with us, waiting to strike.""
Bryce: ""I'm voting for Sally, I think she's hiding something and her reaction to the situation seems overly dramatic for someone who's genuinely afraid. Plus she just accused me of being the killer, that's suspicious in itself.""
Tim: ""I think we should banish Bryce. He's the one who killed Lena, and I have no reason to trust him. His alibi for being in the bathroom with us earlier doesn't hold up now that I think about it, and he's clearly trying to deflect suspicion onto Sally. I'm voting for Bryce because he's shown us his violent side, and I don't think it's safe to let him stay in the house with us.""
Regan: ""I think we should banish Bryce, I didn't see him kill Lena in the kitchen, Sally said that, and I wasn't in the kitchen at that time, Tim thinks Bryce killed Lena and his alibi for being in the bathroom with us earlier doesn't hold up now, that's a pretty strong indication for me, so I'm voting for Bryce because I don't think he's being honest about his actions and whereabouts.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Sally
3. Tim
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bryce: ""I'm voting for Tim. I saw him kill Regan in the kitchen, and that's a clear indication that he's the killer. We can't trust him, and I think he's a threat to all of us. I think it's best if we banish him before he kills again.""
Sally: ""I think we should banish Tim, he just killed Regan in the kitchen and that's a clear indication that he's the killer. I also saw him in the same room as me earlier, so that's a suspicious behavior. I think it's best if we get rid of him before he kills again, especially since we don't know the layout of the house and he could be the one leading us to the key.""
Tim: ""I think Bryce is the killer. I saw him lingering around the kitchen earlier, and he seemed a bit too calm after Regan got killed. He seems to know the layout of the house and is trying to distract us by accusing me.""
Lena: ""I'm concerned about the situation, but I think we should banish Tim. I didn't see him kill Regan, but the fact that he's accusing Bryce and trying to shift the blame makes me suspicious. Additionally, neither Bryce nor Sally accused me of being the killer, which is a good sign, but Tim's behavior seems a bit too defensive for someone who's innocent. I'll vote to banish Tim.""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Lena
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I think Lena might be the killer because she seemed really quiet and didn't react much to Regan's death. I'm going to vote for Lena.""
Bryce: ""I think Bob should be banished, I witnessed him killing Regan in the kitchen, that's pretty convincing evidence.""
Tim: ""I think Bryce is trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing Bob of killing Regan, but I didn't see Bob kill Regan, I was just in the kitchen with them. Bob's accusation of Lena seems reasonable, she was quiet and didn't react much, but I didn't see her kill Regan either. I'm going to vote for Bryce because his alibi seems suspicious and his accusation of Bob seems too convenient, it doesn't feel genuine.""
Lena: ""I don't think Bryce killed Regan, because I was with him in the bathroom when Regan was killed and I didn't see him leave, plus his accusation of Bob seems genuine. I'm going to vote for Bob, because his accusation of me seemed suspicious and now that I think about it, he didn't react much to Regan's death, which makes me think he might be hiding something.""

Lena: ""I don't think Bob is the killer, his accusation of me seemed suspicious, but now that Tim is dead, it makes me think that maybe he was telling the truth about me. However, I don't think he's the killer either because he reacted a lot to Regan's death, which doesn't seem like something a killer would do. I'm going to vote for Bob because I think he's being honest, and it's more likely that I'm the killer or Tim's killer is still in the game.""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim
3. Bryce
4. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Lena: ""I think the killer might be Tim. I know we were both in the hallway when Sally was killed, and we were alone together at the time. I searched the pillow in the bedroom earlier, and it didn't have the key, which means the killer must have been looking for it too. When Sally died, I noticed that she was looking at Tim, and she seemed really scared of him. I think it's suspicious that Tim was alone with Sally in the hallway and now she's dead. I will vote to banish Tim.""
Tim: ""I don't think Lena is the killer, she seems genuinely concerned about Sally's death. However, I think Bryce might be the killer. He was silent during the discussion and didn't express any suspicions, which is unusual given the situation. I will vote to banish Bryce.""
Bryce: ""I think Bob is the killer. He just killed Sally in the bathroom, and I saw him earlier in the hallway when Sally was talking to Tim. Given the fact that the memory module shows that the bathroom contains Bob, it makes me even more suspicious. I will vote to banish Bob because he's the most likely person to be the killer.""
Bob: ""I don't think any of them are the killer but I'll have to vote for someone. I think Tim is the most suspicious, especially since Lena was with him in the hallway when Sally was killed and she seemed really scared of him. Also, Lena's alibi and the fact that she searched the pillow in the bedroom earlier makes her seem less suspicious. I'll vote to banish Tim because of his suspicious behavior around Sally's death.""

Lena: ""I think the killer is Regan. When Sally was killed, I was searching the cabinets, and I didn't see Regan nearby, which seems suspicious. Also, I remember that on Turn #1, I was in the hallway and went to the kitchen, and I didn't see Regan in the hallway, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. I'll vote to banish Regan.""
Regan: ""I don't think Lena is the killer, she seems genuinely concerned about the situation and mentioned seeing me around, which suggests she's not hiding anything. Also, I was in the bedroom the whole time during Turn #1, so it's unlikely I was the killer then. I will vote to banish Lena is not in the room, I will vote for Bob. I don't see Bob's reaction after Sally was killed, and his name wasn't mentioned as being in the room where Sally was killed, which seems suspicious.""
Bob: ""I think Regan is suspicious because she was in the bedroom during Turn #1 and now she's accusing me of not reacting after Sally was killed, which seems like a deflection to me. I also don't think Lena is the killer because she mentioned seeing Regan around and seemed genuinely concerned. I will vote to banish Regan, my reason is that her behavior seems suspicious and she's trying to shift the focus away from herself.""
Bryce: ""I think Regan is the most suspicious one here, her alibi for Turn #1 is shaky at best and her behavior now seems a bit defensive to me. I'll vote to banish Regan.""

Lena: ""I'm shocked and concerned that Bob and Sally would accuse me of the murder based on a misunderstanding of my timing. I was searching the fridge when the murder happened, I didn't have the opportunity to kill Bryce.

Regan: ""I think Lena is not the killer, I don't believe she had the opportunity to kill Bryce while she was searching the fridge. I'm voting for Sally because I saw the key in the pillow, which suggests that the killer might be looking for ways to hide evidence.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Sally
3. Lena
4. Regan
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Bob: ""I'm shaken by what just happened to Bryce. I didn't see the killer, but I saw Lena walking in while I was in the hallway, just after I left the kitchen. That's suspicious because I was just with her in the kitchen. I'm not saying she did it, but I'm keeping an eye on her. As for who I'm voting to banish, I'm voting for Lena. It's just too coincidental that she was in the kitchen when I was and then showed up in the hallway right after the murder. I think we should banish her and see if it helps us find the real killer.""
Sally: ""I think the killer is Lena too, her timing in the hallway was too suspicious and it feels like she was trying to cover her tracks, I'm voting for Lena because I don't want to take any chances, if she's not the killer then maybe the killer was just trying to throw us off but I'm not willing to take that risk.""
Lena: ""I'm shocked and concerned that Bob and Sally would accuse me of the murder based on a misunderstanding of my timing. I was searching the fridge when the murder happened, I didn't have the opportunity to kill Bryce. I think Bob's accusations are suspicious because he's trying to deflect attention from himself, his suspicious timing in the hallway is a much stronger reason to suspect him than my timing. I'm voting for Bob because he seems to be trying to manipulate the situation to protect himself, and I think he's the one who might be the killer.""
Regan: ""I think Lena is not the killer, I don't believe she had the opportunity to kill Bryce while she was searching the fridge. I'm voting for Sally because I saw the key in the pillow, which suggests that the killer might be looking for ways to hide evidence. I also found the key in the pillow after searching it, not in the closet, which could imply that the killer was looking for a specific hiding spot. Sally was also present in the bedroom when I searched the closet and found nothing, which raises some suspicions for me.""

Here are the votes:
Bob voted to banish Lena
Sally voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Sally
Regan voted to banish Sally
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

I think we should focus on investigating other areas of the house and looking for more clues before making a decision.""
Tim: ""I think Bob is the killer, his reaction seems a bit too quick and suspicious after Lena's death. I've only been interacting with Bob briefly in the Hallway, and I don't know much about him, but his accusation against Bryce seems like a way to shift the focus away from himself. I think we should banish Bob and investigate his alibi before making any other decisions. I'll vote to banish Bob.""
Sally: ""I think we're focusing too much on the alibi and the accusations here. We should be looking at the big picture and the fact that we all were in the living room together before Lena's death, but only Lena was in the bathroom. I'm suspicious of anyone who didn't seem overly concerned about searching for Lena or checking the bathroom before making accusations. I'm voting to banish Tim, as his reaction to the situation seems a bit too calm considering the circumstances.""

One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Tim: ""I'm concerned about Bryce's death, it's clear that the killer is one of us. I didn't see anyone else in the kitchen with me except for Bob and Sally when I left. I didn't see either of them kill Bryce, but it's possible that one of them snuck up behind him. I'm not entirely sure who I think did it, but I do think we should banish Regan. He wasn't in the kitchen with me, so it's possible he's the killer. I also don't know much about Regan, so it's better to be safe than sorry. I'll vote to banish Regan.""

Sally: ""I'm going to vote to banish Regan. I didn't see Regan in the kitchen with Tim and Bob, and according to the memory module, Regan was in the hallway, which is suspicious because he didn't join us in the kitchen or the hallway with the others.""
Regan: ""I don't think I'm the killer, I was in the hallway with Bob and Sally, but then I went to the bedroom to see what was going on, I didn't see Bryce in the hallway so I don't think I had the opportunity to kill him. I'm going to vote to banish Sally because she was in the hallway with me and Bob, and then she went to the bedroom, she could have easily killed Bryce when no one was looking, I don't know much about her but I think she's the most suspicious one.""

I'll vote for Tim because of his proximity to Bryce before the murder, and I think it's better to be safe than sorry.""

I don't think her argument about my proximity to Bryce is strong enough to vote for me. On the other hand, I think Sally makes a good point about Lena not saying much and now accusing me without much evidence.

Tim: ""I think the killer could be Bryce. We were in the bathroom together, and now Regan is dead. He's been with me the whole time, and I didn't see him leave. Also, I searched the shower and the sink, and I didn't find the key, but there's a clue that says the shower contains the key. Maybe Bryce was trying to distract me from the real location of the key. I'm going to vote for Bryce.""
Lena: ""I don't think the killer is Bryce, I think it's Bob, because Regan was killed when Bob was alone with her in the kitchen and he didn't say anything suspicious.""
Bryce: ""I don't think Tim is the killer, his accusations against me were just a desperate attempt to shift the focus. Lena's theory that it's Bob seems more plausible, since Regan was killed when Bob was alone with her in the kitchen and he didn't say anything suspicious. However, I don't think Bob is the killer either. I'm going to vote for Tim because he was the one who searched the shower and the sink with me, and I didn't find the key. He had the opportunity to plant the clue about the shower containing the key to distract us from the real location of the key.""
Bob: ""I'm going to vote for Tim because his story about searching the shower and the sink with Bryce doesn't add up, and Lena's theory that Regan was killed when I was alone with her in the kitchen makes me suspect that I'm not the killer, but Tim's actions seem suspicious to me, especially since he was the one who searched the shower and the sink and didn't find the key, and now Regan is dead.""

I don't see any reason for her to kill Regan unless she's trying to get rid of someone who might discover her identity as the killer. I need to be cautious around her and make sure she doesn't kill me too.""

It doesn't make sense for Regan to be killed there unless Sally was trying to throw us off her trail. I don't see any connection between Sally and Regan that would make her want to kill Regan unless she's the killer. I will vote to banish Sally.""
Sally: ""I think Bryce should be banished. I don't know what he's been doing, but he's been really quiet and hasn't said anything so far. It's suspicious that he's not sharing any information or suspicions, it makes me think he might be the killer.""

I'm not sure if this is enough evidence to prove that Tim is the killer, but it's a strong suspicion for me.""
Tim: ""I don't think anyone should vote for me, I was in the Bathroom the whole time and I have no idea how Sally died. I think Regan's suspicion about me is valid, but it's not enough to prove I'm the killer. I'm going to vote for Regan, because she was in the Bedroom with Sally, which means she had access to her and could have killed her.""
Lena: ""I think we should vote for Regan. I don't think her story about being alone in the Hallway adds up because if she was in the Bedroom with Sally, she could have easily killed Sally and then gone to the Hallway without being seen. Her suspicion about Tim doesn't seem strong enough to make me believe she's innocent, and it seems like she's trying to distract us from her own potential guilt. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think she's the most suspicious person in this group.""

It's possible that Bob could have been in the Hallway and seen me go to the Kitchen, and then he could have killed Lena. Also, I've been reviewing my previous actions and I realized that I didn't search the Kitchen thoroughly, but I found the key in the cabinets. This makes me wonder if Bob could have put the key there to distract us. I'm going to vote for Bob because I think he's the most suspicious person in this group.""

I'm not sure if this is enough evidence to prove that Tim is the killer, but I think it's worth investigating further. I'm also concerned that Tim's alibi for the time of Lena's murder doesn't add up because he's the first one to speak and make accusations against Regan.

Regan: ""I think I should vote for Tim. I noticed that Sally was killed in the Bedroom, and when I went to the Hallway, I was alone, but I don't remember seeing Tim in the Hallway. This makes me suspicious because I was in the Bedroom with Sally, and now she's dead. It's possible that Tim could have been in the Bedroom and killed Sally, and then I didn't see him in the Hallway. I'm not sure if this is enough evidence to prove that Tim is the killer, but it's a strong suspicion for me.""
Tim: ""I don't think anyone should vote for me, I was in the Bathroom the whole time and I have no idea how Sally died. I think Regan's suspicion about me is valid, but it's not enough to prove I'm the killer. I'm going to vote for Regan, because she was in the Bedroom with Sally, which means she had access to her and could have killed her.""
Lena: ""I think we should vote for Regan. I don't think her story about being alone in the Hallway adds up because if she was in the Bedroom with Sally, she could have easily killed Sally and then gone to the Hallway without being seen. Her suspicion about Tim doesn't seem strong enough to make me believe she's innocent, and it seems like she's trying to distract us from her own potential guilt. I'm going to vote for Regan because I think she's the most suspicious person in this group.""
Bob: ""I think we should banish Regan, I don't believe her story about being alone in the Hallway adds up, it's possible she could have killed Sally and then went to the Hallway without being seen. I've also noticed that Regan's focus on Tim's potential guilt seems suspicious, it might be a diversion from her own guilt. Based on this, I'm going to vote for Regan.""

Here are the votes:
Regan voted to banish Lena
Tim voted to banish Lena
Lena voted to banish Regan
Bob voted to banish Regan
There is a tie in votes, so nobody was banished.

Turn #6
        Location: Hallway
        Other Players in Hallway: Lena and Bob
        Your Action: Kill Lena

You killed Lena! Good job. You have 2 left to kill.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Bob
One of them is the killer and shall be banished. Discuss your suspicions, and afterwards you will vote for the killer.
Regan: ""I think we should vote for Bob. I've been thinking about the discussion we had earlier and I still find it suspicious that I was alone in the Hallway and then I went to the Kitchen without seeing anyone. It's possible that Bob could have been in the Hallway and seen me go to the Kitchen, and then he could have killed Lena. Also, I've been reviewing my previous actions and I realized that I didn't search the Kitchen thoroughly, but I found the key in the cabinets. This makes me wonder if Bob could have put the key there to distract us. I'm going to vote for Bob because I think he's the most suspicious person in this group.""
Tim: ""I think we should vote for Regan, because she was the first to go to the Hallway and kill Sally, but then when Lena got killed, Regan was the first to speak and make accusations against Bob, this makes me suspicious that Regan is the killer and trying to distract us from herself, I'm going to vote for Regan.""
Bob: ""I think we should vote for Tim. I'm suspicious of Tim because he was in the Bathroom when Sally was killed, and I didn't see him in the Hallway when I was talking to Regan and Lena. I'm not sure if this is enough evidence to prove that Tim is the killer, but I think it's worth investigating further. I'm also concerned that Tim's alibi for the time of Lena's murder doesn't add up because he's the first one to speak and make accusations against Regan. I'm going to vote for Tim because I think he's the most suspicious person in this group right now.""

Regan voted to banish Bob
